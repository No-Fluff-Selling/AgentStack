With the pandemic shifting how so many workplaces function, facilities managers have seen a growing list of responsibilities in the past three years. In addition to rethinking real estate and office space design to accommodate changing work models, integrating more data into operations and adapting to evolving guidelines around sustainability , facility managers are also being forced to run with stricter budgets, comply with new building regulations and still ensure smooth day-to-day operations. 
 Some of the role has stayed the same since before the pandemic. They still have to hire and organize personnel, manage contracts, keep up with preventative and emergency maintenance, handle inventory, negotiate leases and fill empty space in their buildings. 
 But a number of ongoing factors has caused each of these tasks to grow more complex, time-consuming and costly. So where are facility managers focusing their attention? Below are some of the major trends affecting the facilities management industry in the second half of the year. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Artificial intelligence is being used in facilities to determine equipment maintenance status.

 Buildings are getting more complex 
 As technology advances in and outside of buildings, facility managers are increasingly tasked with managing new systems. Core HVAC, electrical, engineering and safety systems are all being upgraded to be more energy efficient, more interconnected and increasingly integrated with IoT systems via building information systems , which monitor functions and report data to operations management platforms. 
 Buildings, for example, are getting updated air filtration systems , originally spurred by pandemic concerns. There are also new electrical management systems that control the flow of electricity to essential infrastructure and AI-driven sensors that detect unusual behavior and alert security officials. 
 By taking a more unified approach to building management, oftentimes through integrated workplace management systems , facilities managers can gather information from both amenities and operations segments to better understand a facility’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as introduce workflow efficiencies. 
 But with new upgrades comes new needs for wireless and wired internet, cybersecurity and IT systems. All require expertise to operate and could bring a building to halt if they fail, leading to an immediate loss of revenue and expense to fix. 
 While facility managers have traditionally come from technical backgrounds, with many previously working as hard skill technicians, these new systems require even more complex knowledge about a facility's operations and ability to understand the data coming in from all the various technologies. A recent survey by Toggled found that while a majority (78%) of facility decision-makers have deployed smart building features, over a third (38%) say they lack the skills and talent to integrate the required data science into their smart building platforms. 
 “There are so many different sources of data now. It used to just be sort of, ‘I've gotten my utility bills from my electric and gas company, maybe we're using a little bit of diesel in our generator, something like that,’” said Dan Scher, vice president of strategic planning and environmental stewardship at Medxcel. “Now, as you get into more of a carbon oriented world, those data sources sort of explode exponentially. And so you're getting into a lot of other parts of the business that may not have been just traditional facilities focus.” 
 As the number of data sources continues to grow, facilities managers must learn to gather, organize and analyze this information in an efficient way. 
 In addition to electrical, mechanical, plumbing, lighting and structural maintenance data from traditional facility condition assessments, management is now tracking a litany of other data types and sources. These include climate sensors, occupancy and office scheduling, air filtration, carbon emissions, safety system inputs and third-party work order information, among others. 
 “The No. 1 challenge is data, and getting good clean data that you can analyze,” Scher said. “I think most facilities managers have a good working sense of the facility and being able to couple that experiential learning with the data, I think, is a differentiator.” 
 As a result of this technical growth, companies like Infogrid , BrainBox AI and Sidewalk Labs are popping up to connect all of a building’s data in new ways, using this information with AI to determine efficiencies and automate building controls. While these next-generation buildings may not be the norm for a while, if ever, they point to a future with progressively complex systems that facilities managers will need to contend with.

 More building regulations push facility managers to adapt quickly 
 On top of the complexity, buildings are being regulated more at federal, state and local levels, such as California’s AB 2446 , which requires life cycle assessments and environmental product declarations in new buildings, and proposed AB 593 , which would require the California Energy Commission to craft a building emissions reduction strategy with milestones to be implemented by 2025. There’s also New York City’s Local Law 87 , which requires energy audits and retrofitting for buildings within the city. 
 Evolving environmental standards around the country have pushed many organizations and municipalities to focus on improving their buildings to operate more sustainably to lower their carbon emissions. 
 The 2023 National Electrical Code was also published at the end of last year, ushering in new codes and standards for building operators. Many of the updates since 2020 focus on the importance of technology in today’s buildings, with the new code granting electrical authorities the ability to examine cybersecurity considerations and encouraging enhanced energy efficiency through the use of energy management systems and electric vehicles. 
 
 
 
 “Benchmarking is absolutely that first step that you need in order to initiate further actions, like a building performance standard, because you very much need all of that data.” 
 
 
 Ben Levine 
 Program manager, Buildee 
 
 
 
 Air quality is another building component pushing facility managers to adapt, with multiple government agencies and industry regulators beginning to create standards and guidelines for ensuring safe air in buildings. 
 Most recently, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers released a draft for public review of its first-ever standard for mitigating the airborne spread of infectious pathogens in indoor spaces. The announcement came soon after the CDC offered guidance on building ventilation , recommending at least five air changes per hour of clean air in occupied spaces. 
 Benchmarking gains significance amid all the data 
 Shifting regulations creates a glaring issue: Many facility management companies don’t know how their buildings stack against these goals. This leads facility managers to question how they can improve to meet regulations in an economically feasible way. 
 Another problem is that while there are standards and building codes that ensure safety, many facilities management-oriented benchmarking often lacks a strategic position in organizations and is often performed by individuals with no formal benchmarking experience, leading to underperformance in evaluating buildings and creating action plans, according to a research paper from UNC-Charlotte . 
 Sustainability benchmarks related to carbon output, net-zero offset credits and emission scopes are still being ironed out and differ between municipalities and regions, creating confusion. 
 “Benchmarking is absolutely that first step that you need in order to initiate further actions, like a building performance standard, because you very much need all of that data,” said Ben Levine, program manager at Buildee, a software provider for municipalities, utilities and building owners. 
 “It's sort of like crawl before you run. You would not be able to put forward a building performance standard if you hadn't already put forward a benchmarking policy over a few years, which enables you to gather all of that data, understand exactly what sort of structure your building performance policy should take, what sort of timeline it should have, what owners should be tackling first,” Levine said. 
 Organizations that implement regular facility benchmarking programs experience improvements and savings in their operations, but this requires support from top management all the way to the professionals running operations on the ground floor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Amenities are increasingly important for facility leads, as occupiers demand more to draw employees in-office.

 Rise in amenities, hospitality services to make properties more attractive 
 The shift to remote, hybrid and flexible work models has slashed the amount of office space needed by companies, and put pressure on building owners to offer new amenities and services to attract tenants . So in addition to running critical infrastructure of a building, facilities managers are also often tasked with sourcing and overseeing amenities, such as health and wellness centers, transportation hubs, daily convenience markets and more. 
 SGA’s recent Workplace Amenities Report reflects these larger societal shifts, with survey respondents demonstrating a greater focus on personal well-being and safety, interest in sustainable modes of transportation, convenient places to grab food and packages, and spaces that facilitate social interaction. 
 According to the study, 45% of respondents said a “post-workout nourishment station” is a must-have or strongly desirable, while 67% had the same sentiment about having a basic unstaffed fitness center. Almost half (49%) said a convenience store was at least highly desirable, and 75% said a grab-and-go providing pre-made breakfast or lunch was desired. 
 Almost half of respondents also said bike parking was strongly or somewhat desirable, which in turn also leads to greater security needs for facility managers.

 Labor issues will continue to eat into operating costs 
 Labor is one of, if not the largest, expenditure for facility managers currently, according to the 2022 Facilities Management Cost Trends report by CBRE, with it unlikely to decrease even after workforce shortages and logistics challenges resolve. 
 While supply chain challenges have softened since then, the labor market hasn’t, with organizations and operators of all scopes and sizes experiencing difficulty in sourcing and retaining labor. This has led to continuing wage increases and high employee churn, in turn creating high training costs and making it hard for facility managers to maintain their staffing levels. 
 Another field service operations report by Blumberg Advisory Group echoed these sentiments among operators, finding that labor supply of W2 and 1099 employees was the most significant factor for rising operating costs (25%), followed by higher prices for spare parts and tools (23%). It also found that the inflated costs of these two segments were the most common challenge that operators face in achieving high customer satisfaction (48%). 
 Outsourcing and out-tasking has proven to be an effective way for many building owners and facility managers to alleviate some of the pain associated with the current labor market. However, it takes control out of an organization’s hands, leading some to question if it is a reliable way to cut costs. 
 “Trends would dictate that when times are bad, companies tend to outsource more,” said Mia Mends , chief executive of Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s facility services subsidiary, C&amp;W Services. “What I’m seeing is our current clients are looking for discounts, and I’d say first-generation [clients are] also wary, because it’s an unknown. There’s an aversion to risk.” 
 Despite what Mends says is a 50-50 split between in-house and outsourced facilities service, she believes that ongoing economic pressures do have the potential to further increase the amount of organizations that choose to outsource their facilities' labor. 
 “But I think we’re slowly seeing more first-generation clients. Ask me in a year, I want to get through this year, potentially a recession and we’ll be able to answer that question, but technically there should be a positive correlation between economic decline and more outsourcing. I’ll tell you next year whether or not we were able to prove that,” Mends said. 
 New skills are needed as job duties expand 
 Since facilities management professionals traditionally come trained with hard skills like electrical or plumbing, they are used to handling maintenance — from repairing water heaters to replacing air filters — themselves, but they are now being asked to do more with less. It is becoming much harder to juggle all of these tasks as their jobs also require new skills such as overseeing tech vendors, hiring third-party tradespeople for in-building maintenance or working with IoT professionals to track and maintain building systems. 
 The expansion of job duties has led to increased outsourcing for a range of functions, including using vendors to offer amenities to tenants, contracting with a third-party company to handle landscaping or waste removal, or shifting all hard facilities maintenance to a large servicing firm. 
 A recent CBRE report, “ Facilities Management Procurement Perspectives ,” found that 58% of organizations' primary facilities management model is outsourced, with another 25% saying they primarily out-task (using third-parties for tactical roles like janitorial or engineering). Only 15% of respondents said the majority of facilities management staff is in-house, highlighting market growth for facility management service providers like CBRE and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and the rising need for those in-house facility managers to find external labor for specific tasks. 
 This growth of outsourcing is placing a greater importance on skills like communications and negotiations. There is also a growing pressure for facilities managers to report to stakeholders. 
 The CBRE report, which sampled facility managers’ procurement and corporate priorities, found that business leaders are paying closer attention to real estate portfolios due to its potential for achieving sustainability goals, driving cost savings and fostering company culture. 
 The survey, which included responses from more than 40 corporations in varying sectors, found that 20% of facility manager procurement leaders called employee and stakeholder satisfaction as their “top priority,” second only to quality and service improvement (23%) and ahead of competitive pricing and cost savings (19%).

 Predictive data could create shift from reactive to proactive model 
 At the core, a facilities manager is tasked with keeping buildings running smoothly, generating operational efficiencies and making sure tenants are happy. The growing adoption of sensors and new data sources provides more things for operators to keep track of, but also a lot of information to inform building decisions and create labor efficiencies. 
 A key example would be for maintenance. According to a webinar with JLL Technologies, which discussed its soon-to-be-released State of Facilities Management survey, managing routine tasks and maintenance take up the majority of time for more than half of respondents. The report states this is where facilities managers are most reliant on automation, due to increased workloads and staffing issues. 
 In turn the survey also found that most facilities managers (67%) see building a predictive maintenance strategy as their top asset management priority in the new year, with JLLT also noting that 41% of all assets tracked on its Corrigo computerized maintenance management system software are on preventative maintenance schedules. 
 The adoption of integrated building management technology means managers can have greater insight and control into the systems that keep a facility running and can use this information to generate action plans, create maintenance schedules and demonstrate cost-savings to investors or owners. 
 Add in occupancy data, gathered from mobile apps or sensors that track employee activity, and operators can begin to have a better view of how specific areas of a facility are used. If a facility manager knows that a certain conference room is used more, they can adjust cleaning and air filter maintenance schedules to account for that. If they know that a storage area is only used a few times a year and doesn’t have much traffic, they can keep the temperature colder and replace the lighting less frequently. 
 All of this enables operators to shift from a reactive approach to a proactive maintenance model, which protects facility budgets from expensive emergency repairs and outages. This also means that facility managers don’t have to send out technicians as often to repair or maintain less-utilized equipment, enabling them to focus their resources on more important jobs. 
 While industry adoption for these integrated, predictive building systems is still ramping up, it appears this technology will be a crucial factor for operators moving forward. 
 “The next level is having more modern building management systems, having automation around it and having the ability to auto schedule certain capabilities in the building that way,” said Sadiq Syed, vice president and general manager of Connected Enterprise at Honeywell. [Citation: 24]

Thought Leadership 
 
 The facilities management market is serious business. By 2032, its value is expected to top $5 trillion. Despite this positive outlook, operations leaders still face many challenges. From sky-rocketing energy prices to the push for sustainability, there’s a lot to consider. So how can operations leaders head into the new year with the right priorities? […]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The facilities management market is serious business. By 2032, its value is expected to top $5 trillion . Despite this positive outlook, operations leaders still face many challenges. From sky-rocketing energy prices to the push for sustainability, there’s a lot to consider. 
 So how can operations leaders head into the new year with the right priorities? Here are four trends to help make the right decisions and navigate uncertainty. 
 1. Connected facilities powered by IoT continue to gain momentum. 
 The Internet of Things (IoT) positively impacts an organization’s business and protects its bottom line. Today, the number of IoT devices is 15 billion, but that’s expected to almost double by 2030. 
 A connected facility harnesses the power of IoT to reduce costs and enhance operational efficiencies. The analytics gathered from a connected facility provide invaluable insight into everything from product safety and equipment performance to decreasing maintenance and increasing profitability. By tapping into the power of automation, operations leaders can maintain a competitive advantage, deliver a quality experience, and cut costs . 
 2. Optimizing energy consumption is the key to surviving cost hikes. 
 Businesses everywhere are facing steep hikes in energy costs this winter (and for the unforeseeable future). The significant increase, combined with high gasoline prices, supply chain issues, spending weariness, and inflation, is creating a myriad of challenges for business owners. This has left many searching for innovative ways to cut costs and improve bottom lines. 
 With the right asset and energy management solutions , operations leaders can optimize and drastically reduce energy consumption through better visibility into equipment on/off usage patterns, the ability to control lighting, signage, and other equipment remotely, enterprise-level HVAC control and diagnostics, and more. 
 3. Business sustainability is crucial. 
 Since the facilities management market is growing so rapidly , sustainability isn’t a trend anymore; it’s a necessity. As a result, operational leaders are hard-pressed to deliver results from two different vantage points—(1) minimizing the organization’s impact on the environment and (2) finding ways to sustain its growth. 
 That’s why sustainability needs to be part of a larger strategy that includes environmental considerations across the entire supply chain and all business operations. Energy consumption and capital equipment are key areas where sustainability goals, combined with the right solution, can lead to significant results . 
 4. Considering an integrated approach to facilities management. 
 When operations leaders take an integrated approach to facilities management, they can simplify day-to-day responsibilities and streamline operations. By bucking siloed operational frameworks (where functions operate as independent entities), a unified system develops. As a result, organizational oversight improves, and costs are reduced. 
 One way to achieve an integrated approach is to arm employees with technology that helps them do their jobs more effectively. By harnessing the power of loT, a connected facility can increase the visibility employees have over equipment and boost productivity. Using loT also makes it possible to overcome connectivity and productivity challenges with automated data collection and proactive maintenance.

The convergence of technology, changing dietary preferences, and heightened awareness of environmental impact are redefining how food services and facility management (FM) operate. From the rise of plant-based diets and local sourcing to the integration of smart technologies that optimize resource use and building efficiency management, the parameters within which industry must operate are getting far more numerous and exacting. 
 Consequently, the complexity of commercial food services and facility management is increasing, leading many more customers to outsource these needs to specialized providers so they can more effectively meet the evolving expectations of their workforce and customers. In a survey of 200 leading buyers of food services and facility management in the United States and Europe, conducted by Oliver Wyman in 2024, 91% expected an increase in their food services and facility management outsourcing budgets over the next five years. 
 
 Exhibit 1: Executive outlook for food services and facility management outsourcing budgets by 2030 
 
 Meanwhile, the food services and facility management industry has become highly fragmented: local and independent providers account for nearly one-third of global outsourced services, while giants like Compass, Sodexo, Aramark, CBRE, Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and ABM leverage economies of scale to build market shares. Since 2016, top food services and facility management players performed over 60 acquisitions to strengthen their market position and continue to look for opportunities to grow. 
 Looking for help with carbon footprints 
 One of the latest pressures on food services and facility management providers comes from major customers, including corporations, universities, hospitals, and sports and entertainment venues, to be more aggressive about cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The demand comes in the wake of recent regulations, particularly in Europe , requiring companies to disclose emissions and provide plans for how to cut them. 
 In the Oliver Wyman survey, 90% said they wanted help from their vendors to shrink their carbon footprints. Service providers can accomplish this by cutting their own operational emissions, which would in in their customers’ supply chains. 
 Reinforcing how important cutting emissions is for customers, two-thirds told the Oliver Wyman survey they would be willing to pay as much as a 10% premium on sustainable offerings from food services and facility management companies that lowered emissions; one-third said they would go as high as 20%. Thus, the need to reduce emissions is transforming sustainability into a critical strategy for the sector, offering a competitive edge for proactive vendors and even potentially a revenue enhancer. By adopting sustainable practices and leveraging them in marketing, providers can not only meet client expectations but also gain an advantage in an increasingly competitive market that is starting to prioritize environmental responsibility. 
 A broader definition of sustainability 
 Sustainability goes beyond just cutting emissions and reflects the new economic environment both customers and providers must navigate, including inflationary costs pressures and the critical role of a reliable supply chain. As a result, the food services industry is placing greater emphasis on cost efficiency, with supply chain operations playing a crucial role in sustaining healthy profit margins. 
 One tactic is through the minimization of the number of stock-keeping units (SKUs). But many providers run into a conflict here with other emerging sustainability trends that prioritize local sourcing, traceability, and sustainable agricultural practices that make it challenging to keep costs low and SKUs limited. 
 Outsourcing in food services and facility management is also on the rise, with the survey showing the two main drivers being rising costs and the need for more consistent service quality. Current global outsourcing rates are approximately 35% and projected to reach 40% by 2027 — with the United States and Europe leading other regions with rates of 47% and 38% in 2023, respectively. 
 Post-COVID corporate life 2.0 
 The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally transformed work dynamics, establishing hybrid and work-from-home models as standard practices. This shift necessitates companies to adapt their office environments to support fluctuating occupancy and enhance employee experiences. As organizations reduce office space and invest in flexible workstations and collaborative zones, the focus is on creating engaging and welcoming workplaces that foster creativity and well-being. 
 The transformative impact of technology 
 Technology plays a vital role in enhancing providers performance. Staying at the forefront of technological advancements, particularly in data and artificial intelligence (AI), is critical for delivering tailored, sustainable, and efficient solutions. Companies can either develop proprietary technologies or pursue strategic acquisitions of disruptors and competitors with technological advantages, ensuring they maintain market leadership and drive growth. 
 Advanced technologies and AI are significantly transforming the food services and facility management industry, with 81% of US food service operators adopting new technologies in the past two years. This shift highlights the growing importance of technology in positioning providers to meet evolving market demands and sustainability goals. 
 The 2024 Oliver Wyman survey identified key use cases for new tech, including analyzing occupancy trends to optimize operations, improving supply chain decisions, and enhancing the accuracy of safety and quality checks. Overall, customers have confidence in their providers’ abilities to deliver next-generation services, with 76% expressing trust in food services and over 90% in facility management companies. 
 Carving a path forward 
 Based on the research, food services and facility management providers have a significant opportunity to evolve from mere solution and service providers to genuine trusted business partners for their customers. They can achieve this role by focusing on a few key factors: 
 Tailored offerings for cost efficiency 
 Providing tailored offerings that deliver customized solutions in unison with cost control allow service providers to better meet the specific needs of their clients while keeping much needed cost efficiency. 
 Strong branding for customer archetypes 
 Developing strong brands to match requirements of selected customer archetypes, particularly in food services. 
 Supporting sustainability goals 
 Helping customers reach their sustainability targets related to food sourcing, building management, and energy efficiency. 
 Attracting and retaining talent 
 Assisting customers attract and retain employees by meeting the new expectations of employees, especially in a post-Covid world, on food choices, sustainability concerns, and work environments. 
 Leveraging tech and AI 
 Relying on latest technologies and AI to deliver cutting-edge services to customers. 
 To meet these new customer expectations and needs, the industry is likely to pursue more consolidation, as it enables key players to expand their presence across the value chain, propose more end-to-end solutions, and continue to pursue the latest technology. [Citation: 27]

The changing face of facilities management: Where is the sector heading? While facilities management started from humble beginnings, it has now earned the respect of company executives as being instrumental in informing strategic decision-making, supporting financial targets and keeping operations running. So, what does the sector look like now? Where has it come from? And most importantly, where is it heading? Introduction 
 It’s no exaggeration to say that facilities managers need to know something about everything. From building maintenance and environmental services, to catering, cleaning and space planning, they are tasked with an array of responsibilities. But, this hasn’t always been the case. 
 Facilities management (FM) as a profession and as a sector started as little more than caretaker and cleaning services in the 1970s, but it has evolved to become a discipline far greater – accepted as a key strategic element in any successful business. 
 So how has the sector grown and what does the future look like? Here we discuss three areas of focus and change and the new technologies supporting the growth of FM careers. 
 
 Focus 1: how is the FM role expanding? Changes in impact and scope 
 Focus 2: How is the FM sector adapting? Changes in technology and trends 
 Focus 3: How is the FM workforce shifting? Changes in demographics and skill sets 
 
 Focus 1: how is the FM role expanding? Changes in impact and scope 
 The contribution made by facilities managers to the successful operation of an organisation is frequently misunderstood and underestimated. The truth is that effective facilities management is vital for an organisation’s strategic and operational objectives. 
By attending to record-keeping, ensuring compliance with regulations and maintaining assets, facilities managers can make the difference between success and failure. And that failure can be costly. In 2016, an investigation by Harlow Council uncovered six years of neglect by G4S Cash Solutions (UK) in managing its water systems, putting staff at risk of exposure to legionella. The company was subsequently fined £1.8 million. 
 Increasingly, the emphasis for facilities managers is shifting from purely asset management to supporting the health, wellbeing and comfort of employees. Working environments are now subject to tighter regulations, working practices have changed and staff wellbeing has become more of a focus – as a result, FMs today are accountable for how a workplace functions for its people, and not just the assets involved in powering the back-end processes. 
 Subsequently, facilities managers now play a key role in designing workplace experiences that communicate and reinforce organisational values. But, the design and maintenance of a workplace is not merely a cosmetic exercise. A recent study has revealed that 67% of workers claimed to have left their last job because of unsatisfactory office design, and 69% cited noise, poor lighting and access to quiet space as crucial factors affecting productivity. Facilities managers need to take account of this changing landscape, providing different types of office space to accommodate both quiet concentration and collaboration. 
 In addition, office space itself has become a more precious and expensive commodity – organisations now value premium buildings and spaces that offer the best value for money, the best impressions and the best environments. Cubicles and closed spaces have increasingly been replaced by modern workplaces that promote social collaboration, rising tech trends and comfort. 
 And as senior management continues to push the boundaries in terms of what they expect from their FM department, the whole industry 
is required to mature at a similar rate to keep pace with changing visibility, expectations and demand. FMs need slick, modern software that can cater to the different elements of their now multi-faceted roles – replacing disparate systems, spreadsheets and workplace silos with central, effective platforms. 
 Role reversal – facilities managers as health and wellbeing advocates 
 At the beginning of 2017, Greg Davies, director of market development at Assurity Consulting forecast a bigger role for facilities managers in tackling occupational health issues: “From an FM perspective, this is all about how we develop and measure wellbeing. The HR issues are more about stress and mental health, but issues of the indoor environment quality – air quality, water quality, temperatures and humidity – they have a direct effect on productivity as well as wellbeing. How all of this is managed 
and measured in the future is key.” 
 As such, the FM industry now has a firm foothold in driving organisations forward. An ageing population, advances in medical care and growing concerns about issues such as obesity and diabetes have important implications for the ways in which facilities managers approach their job. While facilities management professionals have longstanding experience of occupational health, the focus is shifting towards a wider role that takes in wellbeing and preventive measures. 
 Focus 2: How is the FM sector adapting? Changes in technology and trends 
 Using tech to triumph 
 The FM industry has met the same challenges as any other sector when it comes to technological advancement. While it’s come a long way since managing a facility manually with spreadsheets, tech adoption and efficiency still relies on the mentality of an organisation to want to change and do things differently. For most, the tech is there and so are the people – the challenge is how to combine the two constructively. 
 Facilities managers are deploying Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) software to manage and consolidate information across all facets of their responsibilities, from asset tracking to stock control, energy consumption to room bookings. Managing everything from one, central system has the obvious advantages of scalability, resource and time efficiencies and data transparency and management. 
A key focus area for FM remains on mobile technology – people want to keep moving and digital tech needs to be able to cater to this. Senior management is hungry for performance data about how the workplace can operate more efficiently – but they want 24/7 access to it and flexibility in how it’s received. FM mobile technology presents a solution to this problem as demand increases. 
 However, there are signs that for facilities management – and the wider business services sector – the potential of technology has not been fully realised. A recent survey of property and facilities management professionals found that 75% of respondents believe themselves to be at the early stages of their technology journey. And while those already using technological solutions reported benefits concerning reporting, forecasting and compliance, only a small proportion believe they are currently harnessing technology successfully. 
 Budgetary constraints go some way towards explaining a tentative approach to adopting technological solutions. But, there is a need to publicise and promote how software can bring about cost savings, efficiency gains and profitability to catering, cleaning, security 
and other functions under the facilities management umbrella. 
 Pushing technological boundaries 
 While the sector hasn’t always relied on technology, in a competitive, ever-changing environment, digital intervention is now the key to delivering a truly slick, efficient FM division. Growing expectations, workloads and demands mean that Outlook reminders and knowledge living solely in the heads of staff are no longer sufficient to support the needs of a modern day building or business. The benchmark has been raised. 
 Subscribe for more content Intelligent building management systems focus on more granular activity such as room bookings, and there is greater automation in data collection which can be used to inform asset replacement programmes, manage service contracts and understand the true cost of ownership. 
 RFID technology is another key development being introduced to the industry and incorporated in leading CAFM solutions. While RFID tracking is already used effectively across the health sector to manage the movement of equipment and medical records, the same principles can be applied to help FMs boost asset visibility and achieve a more holistic view of operations. By delivering this insight, teams are in a better position to identify multiple uses for assets and find ways for them to work together – not just in isolation. 
 What our 
 customers say 
 “FMs need slick, modern software that can cater to the different elements of their now multi-faceted roles – replacing disparate systems, spreadsheets and workplace silos with central, effective platforms.” 
 “A recent survey of property and facilities management professionals found that 75% of respondents believe themselves to be at the early stages of their technology journey.” 
 “As facilities management makes the transition from a buildingcentric to a user-centric profession, the skills demanded of facilities management professionals will need to reflect this new mandate.” 
 Focus 3: How is the FM workforce shifting? Changes in demographics and skill sets 
 Responding to a new generation 
 Doing more with less, managing rising costs, demonstrating value-for-money, keeping up with technological change – these are just some of the challenges facing facilities managers today. But perhaps the greatest challenge is responding to changes in the workforce, leading to a transformation of the facilities management profession itself, and a new demographic to serve. 
 Say hello to Generation Z. 
 Born between the 1990s and the present day, Generation Z share many of the characteristics of millennials, but have an identity of their own: “They are the early adopters, the brand influencers, the social media drivers, the pop-culture leaders. They comprise nearly two billion people globally, and they don’t just represent the future, they’re creating it.” 
 Accountancy firm Deloitte has forecast that this group will make up 75% of the global workforce by 2025. As this demographic grows in size and influence, employers are having to take account of the group’s associated values in order to attract and retain staff from this generation. 
 One of the world’s leading business services organisations has suggested that as facilities management makes the transition from a building-centric to a user-centric profession, the skills demanded of facilities management professionals will need to reflect this new mandate. As well as being compliance and service providers, facilities managers are taking on employee engagement roles to demonstrate their organisations’ commitment to sustainability and social responsibility – both of which are important themes for millennials, and for many other workers. 
 FM in a smarter, faster world 
 The world of work may be changing fast, but facilities management – and the technologies supporting it – are changing with it. 
 The role of FMs has always been a balancing act between policing and partnering. Monitoring compliance and maintaining property assets will continue to be important parts of the FM role. But, increasingly, FMs must partner with other workplace professionals to adopt a more holistic approach to employee well-being – and technology needs to play a fundamental role in helping to achieve that. 
 Ultimately, it will be the data and intelligence generated through technology that will help FMs work proactively to accelerate growth. Knowledge is power – and by using the insights collected in a more intelligent, profitable and efficient way, the industry has the potential to have an even bigger impact on driving both organisations and workforces forward. Further integration with the Internet of Things, cloud migration and hosting and tech concepts as far-reaching as speech recognition and augmented reality could present the next phase of facilities management. 
 But the biggest challenge for the facilities managers of today and tomorrow will be to ensure they can maintain both a leadership and operational role, while adapting to a workplace and sector that is continually being redefined. That’s why for those FMs who want to take charge and stay on the front foot without time to wait, technology will be their best friend.

With the pandemic shifting how so many workplaces function, facilities managers have seen a growing list of responsibilities in the past three years. In addition to rethinking real estate and office space design to accommodate changing work models, integrating more data into operations and adapting to evolving guidelines around sustainability , facility managers are also being forced to run with stricter budgets, comply with new building regulations and still ensure smooth day-to-day operations. 
 Some of the role has stayed the same since before the pandemic. They still have to hire and organize personnel, manage contracts, keep up with preventative and emergency maintenance, handle inventory, negotiate leases and fill empty space in their buildings. 
 But a number of ongoing factors has caused each of these tasks to grow more complex, time-consuming and costly. So where are facility managers focusing their attention? Below are some of the major trends affecting the facilities management industry in the second half of the year. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Artificial intelligence is being used in facilities to determine equipment maintenance status.

 Buildings are getting more complex 
 As technology advances in and outside of buildings, facility managers are increasingly tasked with managing new systems. Core HVAC, electrical, engineering and safety systems are all being upgraded to be more energy efficient, more interconnected and increasingly integrated with IoT systems via building information systems , which monitor functions and report data to operations management platforms. 
 Buildings, for example, are getting updated air filtration systems , originally spurred by pandemic concerns. There are also new electrical management systems that control the flow of electricity to essential infrastructure and AI-driven sensors that detect unusual behavior and alert security officials. 
 By taking a more unified approach to building management, oftentimes through integrated workplace management systems , facilities managers can gather information from both amenities and operations segments to better understand a facility’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as introduce workflow efficiencies. 
 But with new upgrades comes new needs for wireless and wired internet, cybersecurity and IT systems. All require expertise to operate and could bring a building to halt if they fail, leading to an immediate loss of revenue and expense to fix. 
 While facility managers have traditionally come from technical backgrounds, with many previously working as hard skill technicians, these new systems require even more complex knowledge about a facility's operations and ability to understand the data coming in from all the various technologies. A recent survey by Toggled found that while a majority (78%) of facility decision-makers have deployed smart building features, over a third (38%) say they lack the skills and talent to integrate the required data science into their smart building platforms. 
 “There are so many different sources of data now. It used to just be sort of, ‘I've gotten my utility bills from my electric and gas company, maybe we're using a little bit of diesel in our generator, something like that,’” said Dan Scher, vice president of strategic planning and environmental stewardship at Medxcel. “Now, as you get into more of a carbon oriented world, those data sources sort of explode exponentially. And so you're getting into a lot of other parts of the business that may not have been just traditional facilities focus.” 
 As the number of data sources continues to grow, facilities managers must learn to gather, organize and analyze this information in an efficient way. 
 In addition to electrical, mechanical, plumbing, lighting and structural maintenance data from traditional facility condition assessments, management is now tracking a litany of other data types and sources. These include climate sensors, occupancy and office scheduling, air filtration, carbon emissions, safety system inputs and third-party work order information, among others. 
 “The No. 1 challenge is data, and getting good clean data that you can analyze,” Scher said. “I think most facilities managers have a good working sense of the facility and being able to couple that experiential learning with the data, I think, is a differentiator.” 
 As a result of this technical growth, companies like Infogrid , BrainBox AI and Sidewalk Labs are popping up to connect all of a building’s data in new ways, using this information with AI to determine efficiencies and automate building controls. While these next-generation buildings may not be the norm for a while, if ever, they point to a future with progressively complex systems that facilities managers will need to contend with.

 More building regulations push facility managers to adapt quickly 
 On top of the complexity, buildings are being regulated more at federal, state and local levels, such as California’s AB 2446 , which requires life cycle assessments and environmental product declarations in new buildings, and proposed AB 593 , which would require the California Energy Commission to craft a building emissions reduction strategy with milestones to be implemented by 2025. There’s also New York City’s Local Law 87 , which requires energy audits and retrofitting for buildings within the city. 
 Evolving environmental standards around the country have pushed many organizations and municipalities to focus on improving their buildings to operate more sustainably to lower their carbon emissions. 
 The 2023 National Electrical Code was also published at the end of last year, ushering in new codes and standards for building operators. Many of the updates since 2020 focus on the importance of technology in today’s buildings, with the new code granting electrical authorities the ability to examine cybersecurity considerations and encouraging enhanced energy efficiency through the use of energy management systems and electric vehicles. 
 
 
 
 “Benchmarking is absolutely that first step that you need in order to initiate further actions, like a building performance standard, because you very much need all of that data.”

 Air quality is another building component pushing facility managers to adapt, with multiple government agencies and industry regulators beginning to create standards and guidelines for ensuring safe air in buildings. 
 Most recently, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers released a draft for public review of its first-ever standard for mitigating the airborne spread of infectious pathogens in indoor spaces. The announcement came soon after the CDC offered guidance on building ventilation , recommending at least five air changes per hour of clean air in occupied spaces. 
 Benchmarking gains significance amid all the data 
 Shifting regulations creates a glaring issue: Many facility management companies don’t know how their buildings stack against these goals. This leads facility managers to question how they can improve to meet regulations in an economically feasible way. 
 Another problem is that while there are standards and building codes that ensure safety, many facilities management-oriented benchmarking often lacks a strategic position in organizations and is often performed by individuals with no formal benchmarking experience, leading to underperformance in evaluating buildings and creating action plans, according to a research paper from UNC-Charlotte . 
 Sustainability benchmarks related to carbon output, net-zero offset credits and emission scopes are still being ironed out and differ between municipalities and regions, creating confusion. 
 “Benchmarking is absolutely that first step that you need in order to initiate further actions, like a building performance standard, because you very much need all of that data,” said Ben Levine, program manager at Buildee, a software provider for municipalities, utilities and building owners. 
 “It's sort of like crawl before you run. You would not be able to put forward a building performance standard if you hadn't already put forward a benchmarking policy over a few years, which enables you to gather all of that data, understand exactly what sort of structure your building performance policy should take, what sort of timeline it should have, what owners should be tackling first,” Levine said. 
 Organizations that implement regular facility benchmarking programs experience improvements and savings in their operations, but this requires support from top management all the way to the professionals running operations on the ground floor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Amenities are increasingly important for facility leads, as occupiers demand more to draw employees in-office.

 Rise in amenities, hospitality services to make properties more attractive 
 The shift to remote, hybrid and flexible work models has slashed the amount of office space needed by companies, and put pressure on building owners to offer new amenities and services to attract tenants . So in addition to running critical infrastructure of a building, facilities managers are also often tasked with sourcing and overseeing amenities, such as health and wellness centers, transportation hubs, daily convenience markets and more. 
 SGA’s recent Workplace Amenities Report reflects these larger societal shifts, with survey respondents demonstrating a greater focus on personal well-being and safety, interest in sustainable modes of transportation, convenient places to grab food and packages, and spaces that facilitate social interaction. 
 According to the study, 45% of respondents said a “post-workout nourishment station” is a must-have or strongly desirable, while 67% had the same sentiment about having a basic unstaffed fitness center. Almost half (49%) said a convenience store was at least highly desirable, and 75% said a grab-and-go providing pre-made breakfast or lunch was desired. 
 Almost half of respondents also said bike parking was strongly or somewhat desirable, which in turn also leads to greater security needs for facility managers.

 Labor issues will continue to eat into operating costs 
 Labor is one of, if not the largest, expenditure for facility managers currently, according to the 2022 Facilities Management Cost Trends report by CBRE, with it unlikely to decrease even after workforce shortages and logistics challenges resolve. 
 While supply chain challenges have softened since then, the labor market hasn’t, with organizations and operators of all scopes and sizes experiencing difficulty in sourcing and retaining labor. This has led to continuing wage increases and high employee churn, in turn creating high training costs and making it hard for facility managers to maintain their staffing levels. 
 Another field service operations report by Blumberg Advisory Group echoed these sentiments among operators, finding that labor supply of W2 and 1099 employees was the most significant factor for rising operating costs (25%), followed by higher prices for spare parts and tools (23%). It also found that the inflated costs of these two segments were the most common challenge that operators face in achieving high customer satisfaction (48%). 
 Outsourcing and out-tasking has proven to be an effective way for many building owners and facility managers to alleviate some of the pain associated with the current labor market. However, it takes control out of an organization’s hands, leading some to question if it is a reliable way to cut costs. 
 “Trends would dictate that when times are bad, companies tend to outsource more,” said Mia Mends , chief executive of Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s facility services subsidiary, C&amp;W Services. “What I’m seeing is our current clients are looking for discounts, and I’d say first-generation [clients are] also wary, because it’s an unknown. There’s an aversion to risk.” 
 Despite what Mends says is a 50-50 split between in-house and outsourced facilities service, she believes that ongoing economic pressures do have the potential to further increase the amount of organizations that choose to outsource their facilities' labor. 
 “But I think we’re slowly seeing more first-generation clients. Ask me in a year, I want to get through this year, potentially a recession and we’ll be able to answer that question, but technically there should be a positive correlation between economic decline and more outsourcing. I’ll tell you next year whether or not we were able to prove that,” Mends said. 
 New skills are needed as job duties expand 
 Since facilities management professionals traditionally come trained with hard skills like electrical or plumbing, they are used to handling maintenance — from repairing water heaters to replacing air filters — themselves, but they are now being asked to do more with less. It is becoming much harder to juggle all of these tasks as their jobs also require new skills such as overseeing tech vendors, hiring third-party tradespeople for in-building maintenance or working with IoT professionals to track and maintain building systems. 
 The expansion of job duties has led to increased outsourcing for a range of functions, including using vendors to offer amenities to tenants, contracting with a third-party company to handle landscaping or waste removal, or shifting all hard facilities maintenance to a large servicing firm. 
 A recent CBRE report, “ Facilities Management Procurement Perspectives ,” found that 58% of organizations' primary facilities management model is outsourced, with another 25% saying they primarily out-task (using third-parties for tactical roles like janitorial or engineering). Only 15% of respondents said the majority of facilities management staff is in-house, highlighting market growth for facility management service providers like CBRE and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and the rising need for those in-house facility managers to find external labor for specific tasks. 
 This growth of outsourcing is placing a greater importance on skills like communications and negotiations. There is also a growing pressure for facilities managers to report to stakeholders. 
 The CBRE report, which sampled facility managers’ procurement and corporate priorities, found that business leaders are paying closer attention to real estate portfolios due to its potential for achieving sustainability goals, driving cost savings and fostering company culture. 
 The survey, which included responses from more than 40 corporations in varying sectors, found that 20% of facility manager procurement leaders called employee and stakeholder satisfaction as their “top priority,” second only to quality and service improvement (23%) and ahead of competitive pricing and cost savings (19%).

 Predictive data could create shift from reactive to proactive model 
 At the core, a facilities manager is tasked with keeping buildings running smoothly, generating operational efficiencies and making sure tenants are happy. The growing adoption of sensors and new data sources provides more things for operators to keep track of, but also a lot of information to inform building decisions and create labor efficiencies. 
 A key example would be for maintenance. According to a webinar with JLL Technologies, which discussed its soon-to-be-released State of Facilities Management survey, managing routine tasks and maintenance take up the majority of time for more than half of respondents. The report states this is where facilities managers are most reliant on automation, due to increased workloads and staffing issues. 
 In turn the survey also found that most facilities managers (67%) see building a predictive maintenance strategy as their top asset management priority in the new year, with JLLT also noting that 41% of all assets tracked on its Corrigo computerized maintenance management system software are on preventative maintenance schedules. 
 The adoption of integrated building management technology means managers can have greater insight and control into the systems that keep a facility running and can use this information to generate action plans, create maintenance schedules and demonstrate cost-savings to investors or owners. 
 Add in occupancy data, gathered from mobile apps or sensors that track employee activity, and operators can begin to have a better view of how specific areas of a facility are used. If a facility manager knows that a certain conference room is used more, they can adjust cleaning and air filter maintenance schedules to account for that. If they know that a storage area is only used a few times a year and doesn’t have much traffic, they can keep the temperature colder and replace the lighting less frequently. 
 All of this enables operators to shift from a reactive approach to a proactive maintenance model, which protects facility budgets from expensive emergency repairs and outages. This also means that facility managers don’t have to send out technicians as often to repair or maintain less-utilized equipment, enabling them to focus their resources on more important jobs. 
 While industry adoption for these integrated, predictive building systems is still ramping up, it appears this technology will be a crucial factor for operators moving forward. 
 “The next level is having more modern building management systems, having automation around it and having the ability to auto schedule certain capabilities in the building that way,” said Sadiq Syed, vice president and general manager of Connected Enterprise at Honeywell. [Citation: 24]

The Future of Facilities Management Solutions: Service Consolidation 
 Over the last two decades facilities management has dramatically changed. 
 Increased economic instability has left energy executives looking for ways to reduce costs without affecting core operations. Often, facility management (FM) is one area that receives such review. 
 Typically, FM is reactive and performed in-house or through many providers, bundling services on an operational level. This paradigm makes operational costs high, service offerings redundant and limits scalability. Furthermore, processes lack standardization across vendors, and the multitude of contract obligations can become a burden for management at all levels. 
 How do you navigate change while ensuring stability? 
 From 90 vendors to 2 
 Seeking to reduce capital and operational expenditures, a global energy company based in California looked at its real estate expenses as a strategic point for savings. 
 Their ultimate solution was to consolidate their FM vendors from 90 separate contracts into two primary partnerships, initially awarding Sodexo soft FM services, and eventually full IFM capabilities across 100 buildings at 47 sites in the United States. 
 This result was an immediate cost saving resulting from streamlined labor expenses, process standardization, supplier safety alignment and optimization of real estate. 
 Implementing this consolidation was ambitious, but once our client gave us the green light our team mobilized in just three months. 
 One approach is to opt for consolidated, outsourced FM services. According to a McKinsey paper, the global market for in-house and outsourced facilities management is estimated to reach $1.9 trillion by 2024, with the outsourced segment accounting for over half the market. It is not just a trend, it is the future of FM. 
 Some important benefits of consolidating FM services include: 
 
 Cost-saving : Streamlining service delivery reduces operational costs. 
 Focus on core business : Operation leaders can focus on managing their specialized teams 
 Improved service levels : Consolidating service providers reduces inefficiencies, redundancies and inconsistencies in service delivery 
 Scalability : IFM is a long-term strategic approach that drives standardized processes throughout the organization 
 Flexibility : IFM services are highly customizable to client-specific needs 
 
 At Sodexo, our Integrated Facilities Management (IFM) services help to manage facilities more efficiently and effectively. Our goal is to improve your competitive advantage by delivering comprehensive service solutions. 
 Our operational approach is to self-perform, providing our clients with specialized services through alliance relationships across portfolios. Our IFM solutions drive operational efficiencies and provide strategic focus by giving our clients: 
 
 One transparent agreement 
 Reduced overhead expenses 
 One single management team 
 Consistency in standards, communication and reporting 
 Performance-based to mitigate risks 
 Centralized FM Operations. 
 
 In addition to effective change management, making the switch to IFM solutions takes a substantial amount of planning. Identifying and onboarding key stakeholders by building business cases and designing a robust implementation roadmap are key to a successful transition. [Citation: 29]

Evolving facilities management trends are bringing new dimensions to the FM industry as disruptive forces continue to shape and reshape the way enterprises think about technology adoption and conducting business. Explore what facilities managers can expect to adopt and embrace in 2025 and beyond. 
 While the challenges faced by facilities and facilities vendors remain aplenty, the growth remains strong and the facilities management industry is projected to grow to USD 1856.44 billion by 2029. This growth can be attributed to facilities management (FM) becoming a core part of business models across industries. 
 FM is now seen as a formidable function for business growth. It brings people and process efficiency, workplace productivity, and sustainability along the way, and dictates how businesses can work. 
 Amidst the shifts that the industry is witnessing, technology has emerged as the strongest transformation driver. The new paradigms of the Internet of Things (IoT) and data-driven operations are opening up new avenues to innovation. Facility managers are thus constantly vying to reinvent the wheel using these capabilities to improve performance, reduce cost, and enhance service quality. 
 However, as the journey to optimizing and innovation continues, the industry needs to harmonize the processes. Those who update themselves faster will emerge as winners in the race. There is more to adopt than just banking on technology. Trends are unfolding fast and some have already started penetrating the industry, only to dominate in forthcoming years. So, 2025 is going to be the year of the facilities management trends that we have rounded up here.

Abstract 
 Healthcare changes dramatically because of technological developments, from anesthetics and antibiotics to magnetic resonance imaging scanners and radiotherapy. Future technological innovation is going to keep transforming healthcare, yet while technologies (new drugs and treatments, new devices, new social media support for healthcare, etc) will drive innovation, human factors will remain one of the stable limitations of breakthroughs. No predictions can satisfy everybody; instead, this article explores fragments of the future to see how to think more clearly about how to get where we want to go. 
 Significance for public health. 
 Technology drives healthcare more than any other force, and in the future it will continue to develop in dramatic ways. While we can glimpse and debate the details of future trends in healthcare, we need to be clear about the drivers so we can align with them and actively work to ensure the best outcomes for society as a whole. Key words: future healthcare technology, human factors Introduction 
 Pluck a nurse and surgeon out of the nineteenth century and transport them into a modern 21 st century hospital and it would be a thoroughly recognizable place, with the same hierarchies and strict cultures. Patients treated as helpless, stripped of their clothes and possessions, lying in beds and almost completely ignorant of their illness. They might be disappointed in our treatment particularly of old people, but I don’t think it would surprise them. 
 If our two time-travellers were able to attend a post-mortem and listen in on a discussion of human error, very little would seem novel. Clinicians would still be in denial, lawyers would still be hovering, and the delay and deny culture would be no surprise. However, the changes that would surprise the nurse and surgeon are all changes to technology. Infusion pumps, dialysis machines, antibiotics, heart valves, MRI scanners, even hand washing stations would be new ideas. All the hidden technology used in the laboratories behind the scenes, from path labs to decontamination, would be startlingly new if it was noticed. 
 Although the medical culture is similar, there have been dramatic technological changes, and actually these changes would be hard to explain. Does anybody even know how an infusion pump works? They used to be clockwork (and before that, gravity fed) and now almost everything contains a computer and has a colourful screen and lots of buttons. Implanted defibrillators that use telephone networks and web sites to keep cardiologists up to date with their patients are just magic; new pharmaceuticals that change moods, change blood pressure, or kill bacteria: all are modern magic. On reflection, given the centuries of stability, it is amazing how much healthcare has changed in the last 150 years – and one wonders how this accelerating pace of change will proceed in the future. 
 Arthur C. Clarke, the prolific futurist and science fiction writer, famously said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Perhaps the main difference for the couple lifted out of the nineteenth century is they are sure it’s magic, whereas we have stopped thinking about it, and just take it for granted! 
 Time-traveling fiction starts to dig into many interesting issues we might normally avoid thinking about. What about organ harvesting? What about enhanced humans? What about the end of antibiotics? Will robots take over? And so on. 
 Some of what seems to us today like science fiction is going to be routine in the future, perhaps even in our lifetimes. Yet much of today’s human story about relationships, hopes, error, grief and denial is going to remain entirely recognizable in the future. We will still have authority gradients, we will still have controversy over human error, and patients will still be made helpless so that they are easier to treat. The reason is that technology is driven by the market: if somebody has an idea that they can turn into a physical realization that they can sell, they can also patent it or license it, and thereby make a return on their investment. This, in turn, will encourage them to find ways of making it smaller and cheaper, and marketing it on a larger scale; thus it is technology-driven. In contrast, human culture does not make profit for anybody. Improving culture means admitting somebody or some process was not good enough to start with, and who wants to do that, especially when lawyers are watching? There is little economic incentive to improve culture. 
 Atul Gawande makes a similar point about the World Health Organization’s Surgical Safety Checklist. 1 The checklist is a simple piece of paper that helps change human behaviour – it helps check the patient has been correctly identified, helps introduce everybody by name (to reduce authority gradients), and so on. It’s simple and saves lives – more effectively than many drugs. Gawande asks who will promote such an idea when nobody makes any profit from it? It’s just a bit of paper anybody can print. If it was a technology (such as a patented drug) that promised the same improvements in outcomes, everybody would be buying it, and the pharmaceutical company making it would be promoting it heavily. Patients would ask for it to be used. But a piece of paper anybody can print is not exciting enough. Crucially, the only person who benefits from the checklist is the patient (the clinicians benefit indirectly, because more successful operations mean less litigation). The patient is probably unconscious at the very moment they ought to be asking for it! 
 Science fiction 
 Our time-travelling fiction is a small example of the power of using science fiction to help envisage and plan our future. In contrast to the usual tunnel vision prediction of future trends, which often highlight glowingly positive ideas, science fiction lets us explore and communicate futures we want to live in by telling rounded stories we can engage with. More importantly, science fiction can also explore dystopian futures we want to avoid; George Orwell’s 1984 helped avoid his dystopia happening (so far anyway). 
 In the present paper we have not space to create further stories, but we commend the method to both manufacturers and consumers of technology – the hospitals, clinicians and patient groups, and especially to designers. 2 
 When we tell good stories, we get into them, but there is not one story about the future. Anything is possible, and we need lots of stories, to explore good and bad and indifferent choices. Moreover, when we get to the future, it too will have another future. There is not one future, but many. We will never find satisfactory solutions to anything, as there will always be new things to try and explore. This week it might be the Cloud or improved natural language processing, but before we’ve got that working properly, somebody will have invented something that solves even more problems and sounds equally seductive. Yet while technology drives changes in healthcare, the fundamental problems of wellbeing, health and happiness, will remain. 
 The easy story is that the future will be better. Technology will advance and there will always be new and exciting solutions. Today we have robotic keyhole surgery, and things can only get better. We have intelligent decision aids to improve diagnosis, and they will only get better. Some people would point to the underlying drivers: technology is getting faster, better and smaller. Moore’s Law says the speed of innovation is accelerating. The simple story is we will just enjoy the ride. However, the more complex story exposes trade-offs. For example, new computers are indeed much faster, but to take advantage of them we first have had to throw away the slower computers so they can be replaced, and then we may well discover the patient information on the old computers won’t work on the new ones. In fact, we are in a continual struggle to keep up – it costs us a lot, and a lot of solutions that excited us yesterday are already in landfill. The faster we go, then, the more we can expect incompatibilities, and indeed greater spread between those at the sharp end of developments and those without the resources to benefit. When we honestly think about the future, we have to broaden our spotlight from the few exciting ideas that attract our attention to the wider issues, the broader context of change and complexity, in which those innovations could be used effectively. As good science fiction does so well, turning an exciting idea into a fully-worked out story helps us explore the issues more realistically. 
 Rather than develop a single story about the future, this paper now turns to presenting principles, themes and scenarios that a good writer might integrate to create a coherent picture. Key points about futures for healthcare 
 Patients are the reason for healthcare and they should be at the centre of it. This article, however, is about possible technological trends and drivers in healthcare; it should therefore be read in conjunction with patient-cantered perspectives like the Royal College of Physician’s Future Hospital: Caring For Medical Patients report. 3 
 Technology does not have an agenda of helping healthcare, however much we might like to focus on benefits. It develops because of miniaturization, lowering costs of production, and so on, not because it makes people well, but rather because it can find ways of making money and reinvesting it. Koppel and Gordon’s edited book First Do Less Harm is recommended as an overview of issues. 4 
 The pace of change is accelerating: our time travellers from a hundred years ago were surprised at a few things, but had they travelled back in time, with a few minor bumps like William Harvey discovering blood circulation, very little changes all the way back to Hippocrates. 
 Human nature does not change, at least not on these technological timescales. The authority structures in healthcare, the division of labour, the pretence that clinicians know everything, and other human factors are slow to change. Despite our knowledge of germ theory and antisepsis, we are still resistant to washing our hands. 
 There are many futures to plan for. As soon as we get to our future, there will be another – and we will increasingly be seeing partially-completed solutions superseded by even better ideas. Today we might be thinking we just need to computerize all patient records, but before we’ve finished doing that some fancy new technology will change what we want to do or how we should do it. For the foreseeable future, we will have to live with fragmented and partially working technologies. 
 We need to take the future seriously as, literally, it is all we have, and certainly all our children will have – and we can be certain that as we get older, we are going to end up with all the problems of old age. Surely, we want healthcare to improve in the future? We should put effort into future planning, not once, but continuously. 
 In the rest of this article, we will make repeated comparisons between technological factors and human factors. Often these drivers are not aligned (one of the key messages of this article), and technology is therefore unlikely to develop in ways that are optimal for healthcare on its own accord. Our concepts of ourselves, from conception to death, as individuals, families and as communities, are inextricably linked to technological possibilities. We ought to have a Future Healthcare Institute, which will be kept continually busy prioritizing and reprioritizing principles to guide and align healthcare and technological developments together. One imagines such an institute giving guidance legal and regulatory guidance, for example as has already happened in ad hoc ways in some countries addressing advances such as fertilization technologies. Technical factors 
 Healthcare is just a market for technology where consumers such as hospitals are happy to pay enormous amounts of money, particularly for prestige equipment, such as PET and MRI scanners and linear accelerators. 
 Accelerated cost savings 
 Technology automates and extends things that previously had to be done by people. Before infusion pumps, nurses had to give injections every so often; the infusion pump technology automated that. Now the nurse’s time is freed up for other activities, and if the manufacturer has used technology in the production of the infusion pump – as they surely will have – they can reduce the cost of production for exactly the same reasons. Some plastic moulding process will make millions of infusion pumps as easily as it makes one; once one infusion pump has been programmed in software, it costs essentially nothing to program them all. This virtuous circle of using technology to make technology ensures prices drop, market share increases, and profit margins increase, which in turn allows the manufacturer to invest in more cunning production and distribution technologies. 
 However, what is important to notice is that these benefits do not accrue to custom or rare problems that cannot be mass-produced. This means that a technology like an MRI scanner that can scan anyone equally well is going to be much more popular than a technology that has to be customized to a particular patient’s conditions. Personal healthcare 
 Already, the assumptions of mass production are changing. For example, today’s 3D printers are capable of making objects of any shape; they are slightly less efficient than standard mass production, but the costs of custom objects of certain sorts has been lowered significantly. It is now possible to custom make titanium implants the right shape and size to fit. Going further, it is widely envisaged that custom drugs will be manufactured, customized to the patient’s disease and genetic makeup. While this seems to be enormously beneficial to patients, there are dangers. For example, a customized drug may be very effective, but its side effects will be unique to the patient too, and therefore harder to diagnose and manage. 
 Personal healthcare has an interesting technological imperative. If we can personalize healthcare, we get population-sized markets: instead of selling to clinicians, manufacturers can sell to individuals – a market 1000s of times larger. Big data 
 Patients generate huge amounts of information – patient records – from X-rays to blood test results. Replacing paper with computerized summaries makes patient care easier and more efficient. In the future the quantity of information will increase dramatically because of genomics (and the huge genomics of our symbiotic bacteria) and personalized medicine, and as more patient data is collected, more insights will become available. 
 If computers collect data on patient illness, treatments and outcomes, one automatically obtains valuable information on the effectiveness of those treatments, or relations between side effects and patient characteristics across whole populations. Huge amounts of data will be collected, hence the name big data. Once the infrastructures have been set up, the incremental cost of adding one new patient will be essentially nothing, and this economy of scale will drive further technical developments. Epidemiologists will benefit enormously, but the benefits to individuals are less obvious, except in the long run from big data’s contribution to the progress of medical science more generally. Social media, patient power, mobile health and education 
 Stopping people going to hospital in the first place and empowering people to care for themselves and their families is something computers are already doing well. But as patients are empowered, is their new-found knowledge helpful or unrealistically raising their expectations? Today, the internet is problematic, as there is no consistent way anyone can distinguish snake oil from sense, how patients can distinguish reasonable treatment from misguided hope – there will always be a lot of solutions hunting for the patient’s money. Technical solutions to this problem include providing accredited high-quality information; cultural solutions include improving education. When somebody has a knee injury at 40 this should not be the first time they encounter the bewildering amount of variable information and social media on the internet! Their management of their condition – whatever it is – would be much improved if they had been exposed to sensible strategies since preschool. Dramatic, transformational integration of technologies 
 There is not space here to fully explore the vast range of likely and significant technological breakthroughs. Consider nanohealth, brain implants, artificial organs, networked sensors, genomics, exoskeletons ... just a few of the potentially transformative developments already under way. Some of these technologies are going to transform our whole approach to illness and health – in the same way that the nineteenth century development of anaesthetics changed society’s moral approach to pain. Pain and suffering used to be inevitable; now we like to think we have a right to painless procedures – and in turn this has influenced everything, from our treatment of patients to our treatment of animals ( why should animals suffer ? is a very modern question). New technologies, like nanohealth, are going to have ethical implications that will be hard to anticipate. Sometimes ethical issues will be hard to negotiate because they will be apparent only after somebody has got things working and already has a business-driven perspective. Security, privacy and monitoring 
 In a world beset with major security concerns (like terrorism) it is inevitable that all technologies, even in those healthcare, will be aligned with national priorities. For example, taking patients’ fingerprints and other biomedical identifiers will become easier (perhaps driven by consumer finance, such as credit card security); and, as it becomes easier, gathering data for state security will happen as a side-effect of routine clinical practice. The state will be able to identify illegal immigrants and outlaws and others; the current notion of patient confidentiality will be eroded in a way that will be impossible for clinicians to control. 
 Today we may think this would be objectionable, but it is salutary to remember that we happily divulge all sorts of personal information during our use of mobile phones, credit cards, as well as during our use of the internet. We unthinkingly sacrifice our privacy because of the huge convenience of buying stuff on the internet. It seems to make losing our identities a trivial price to pay. When considering future healthcare trends we can expect similar trade-offs; it will be easy to slide into levels of surveillance we do not now like, falling for it because of the healthcare benefits we want. Surveillance is not the only downside of course – paying data rights owners; paying software licenses; signing off responsibilities for insurance liabilities – all happen, and are often signed off without sufficient thought. 
 It is increasingly trivial to collect data about patients and the quality of patient care. This information can be aggregated and help discover variation in treatment and outcomes, and hence help improve quality – which is good. On the other hand, data inevitably distances the manager from the patient as an individual: perhaps the fundamental notions of patient care will lose out to organizational or state concerns, because cost management and security, not care, becomes to be the point of the information. Health 2.0 
 There are many areas where the scale and unit profits of the healthcare market will drive technical developments. Collectively, this technology-driven progress in healthcare is sometimes called Health 2.0, to distinguish it from what we are doing now – Health 1.0. While Health 2.0 is exciting, it is sobering to realize that perhaps it is just the start of an upgrade path: Health 2.0 will have problems we solve with Health 3.1, and in turn that will develop into Health 4 or whatever. While it seems obvious technology will continually advance, it is going to be harder to ensure that each iteration of technology satisfactorily achieves what it claims to achieve, without having to be fixed up and upgraded soon after. 
 Unfortunately, few manufacturers stay in business selling us perfect solutions; they stay in business by selling us something to keep us consuming: a service, something to rent, a disposable product, a product that wears out, or a product that goes obsolete. Certainly Health 2.0 will lead inexorably to more developments, whatever they will be. The danger is that it will make us eager to upgrade before we have even realized the promised benefits of Health 2.0. Somehow, we need to work with manufacturers to align their interests of staying in business with our interests of having a predictable and stable life. We might do that by distinguishing infrastructure, which is provided about once, with consumables that are provided regularly. This is the economic model of infusion pumps: you buy an infusion pump once, but the giving sets are replaced after each infusion. Over time, the manufacturer makes more profit on the easily reproduced plastic tubing than the complex pump, and everyone is happy. 
 In some areas, the consumables will be information itself. This costs nothing to reproduce, but people own it and want to make a return on their investment. Thus patient data will be owned so that its owners – rarely the patients! – can make money from it. Information is stored in computers in data formats, and often these are proprietary: the format of a patient data system belongs to the manufacturer. This leads to the danger that the patient data is inaccessible except on the terms the manufacturer imposes. It may be costly to convert it into other formats, say to upgrade to a different manufacturer’s systems. Worse, if a manufacturer goes bust, some data may be lost. This is a very real problem, as our inability to use data on paper tape, cards, cassette tapes, magnetic tape, VHS tapes – none of them very old technologies – and so forth, testifies. A desirable technological trend, then, in fact a trend that bucks the trend to date, has to be the assurance that data remains accessible and usable over long periods of time – at least a 100 years, which is way longer than any electronic technology! Hacking and open health 
 Healthcare sensors can be readily bought off the internet, and it is easy for technically-minded people today to build sophisticated equipment (to hack ) to collect and analyse any personal or clinical data using their own computers. Credit-card sized computers like Arduinos and a few biomedical sensors cost about the same as a drug prescription! 
 Some individuals are already obsessed with collecting as much health-related data as they possibly can about themselves – it is not just people will illnesses, but people who want to lead healthier lifestyles or be better athletes. If these people upload their data and contribute to aggregated data, they are contributing to citizen health – just like open science, 5 except tackling healthcare problems. At its simplest, they would be contributing to epidemiological studies; at its best, they would be helping build databases and web systems that other people can find their medical conditions in, and hence find support communities. Many patients end up with more time on their hands than they expected, and this is how some choose to use their time: solving their own problems and helping others. 
 Hacking is not restricted to patients: a doctor using a laryngoscope has the choice of paying commercial prices for a video recorder ( e.g., to record images to send to an ENT specialist), or more conveniently recording the video on their iPhone – about a 1,000 times cheaper. 
 The point is, technology is empowering people to do what they want to do, and in the future patients are going to take some of the initiative away from professional healthcare, particularly for diagnosis, chronic illnesses, and lifestyle advice. Technology is diverse and surprising 
 These are some of some powerful technological drivers, and it is hard to draw a line under the discussion. We have not discussed many technologies that are both critical and exciting such as nanohealth, personalized healthcare, mobile health, telehealth and so on – the beginnings of all of these are already available and in use in first adopter places. What the brief discussion illustrates is the diversity, the rapid pervasiveness, and the complex trade-offs of future technologies. Bridging future gaps 
 The science fiction author William Gibson says the future has already happened – we just don’t know where. All the ideas we discuss in this article about the future have happened. 
 From considering technological drivers, we now turn to human futures. We believe these will be more stable and less likely to change, but will raise increasingly unexpected interactions with the new technologies. In areas like human error this is alarming, for if we believe that technology improves – why else would we adopt it? – then, as human error will still occur, the error must even more surely be due to the humans involved, not the improved technologies which were intended to design out error. In other words, the irresistible drive to adopt improved technology may exacerbate our management of human error. The economic drivers that push technologies have vested interests in promoting benefits and belittling problems. And healthcare has no end of problems: we all want and expect better care, costs are rising and performance is declining; living longer, and living with chronic illness, are other problems. Healthcare staff are over-worked and under-resourced... it is hard to imagine technology changing that. On the contrary, many technologies (take MRI scanners, heart implants) are very expensive, and buying into them will exacerbate financial pressures. Safety, security and regulation 
 In the future there will remain an enduring distinction between safety and security. In healthcare these mean different things: safety is about patient and staff safety – basically, following Hippocrates first do no harm – and security is about controlling access, in particular so that intruders, rogue patients and staff cannot get inappropriate patient access, whether that is informational access or physical access. 
 Security means stopping bad people doing bad things. If a bank loses money to fraud, this is not unexpected – we all know there are plenty of bad people around who want to get at our money. It follows that it is the bank’s responsibility to provide security. 
 Safety means stopping good people doing bad things. If a nurse is involved in an untoward incident, this is neither normal nor expected. It is easy, then, to think the good nurse has gone bad and therefore they are to blame – this is the conventional bad apple approach to safety. Indeed, if a good nurse has gone bad, this is a serious betrayal of our high regard of the nurse, which makes things even worse. The bad apple theory is very appealing: getting rid of this bad nurse appears to solve the problem. 
 In short: security is seen as an organizational responsibility ( e.g., the bank’s or the hospital’s), whereas safety is seen as the individual’s responsibility ( e.g., the nurse’s). Technology improves things that generate return on investment (security, speed, efficiency, scale and reach) and safety will not do that while users are scapegoated. 
 Moreover, safety is hard to assess up-front, unlike simple claims for low price, speed or efficiency. Unless regulation requires safety to be assured, we would expect safety to take second place. We therefore anticipate an increasing debate between safety concerns on the one hand and regulatory burden on the other. Since currently the regulatory burden for technology is negligible, certainly compared to the rigors of pharmaceutical development, much could be gained by strengthening regulation. We suggest careful attention needs to be paid to statutory regulation. To avoid hasty regulation that is ineffective or rapidly obsolete, we need to think very clearly. Today there is a lively debate about regulating computer technology; some say (for example) mobile apps should be more tightly regulated; others say that rigorous protocols (such as randomized controlled trials) take so long the technologies will be obsolete once there is formal evidence one way or the other. Solving the right problems 
 Conventional patient records are paper records in folders in cabinets. Many patients have extensive patient records, lab results and so on, and even more patients have patient records that are in many places – in hospitals they have visited, consultant’s offices, general practices, and so on. They are rarely all together where the patient is, often they get lost or duplicated, and sometimes destroyed by fire or floods. Many healthcare providers have trucks shipping patient records around their areas. 
 The obvious thing to do is to computerize all the records, and then use networks to ensure they are always available wherever they are needed. Looking at records on a screen is simpler than wading through piles of paper. Since computers already work, all we need to do is set up a program to scan or type up all the existing paper records. Job done! 
 Unfortunately this obvious solution creates new problems. 
 When a clinician examines a patient, they want to refer to the relevant parts of the patient’s medical history. If we have simply computerized the patient records, all we have done is made the large, scattered piles of paper into something that can be viewed on a computer screen, but now the clinician can only view one window at a time, and they may easily lose the big picture. Information may be scrolled off the screen, or be concealed behind pop-ups. In fact, we have merely swapped the unusability of piles of paper for the unusability of a user interface. 
 While we are very familiar with the ways that paper records can fail, unfortunately we are much less familiar with the ways that computerized records are hard to use and may mislead us. 
 Tom Landauer’s book The Trouble with Computers makes the insightful point that computers are enormously successful in areas where there is commonality that can be computerized — banking, communications, stock control, office documents, email are all good examples. 6 Areas where they have been less successful are those where success depends on the human element. My bank account works just like your bank account, so computerizing either of our accounts is the same as computerizing everyone’s. But my patient records are different to yours. The computerization of my records does not help computerize yours or anyone else’s. Well, that is not quite true. Computerizing my records helps computerize yours, but when those records are used, we and the healthcare professionals using them will have different problems. As the healthcare computer systems scale up to handle more patients, the usability problems get compounded – in contrast, as bank accounts are scaled up, things become more uniform and easier to automate successfully. (Banks also have a very different approach to problems; a British bank does not have to handle my Russian currency or it can charge me exorbitant rates, but a hospital that ignored my X rays would be negligent.) 
 In healthcare, we have to pay more attention to the broad context of how information is used. 
 This is the concern of User Centered Design (UCD), which Landauer describes well. The ideas have been taken up in international standards. In particular, healthcare technologies must be developed using UCD processes, such as ISO Standard 62366 etc. 7 One of the most important features of the standards is that they make clear that new technologies are not going to be perfect and need to be tested and improved to better match how people actually use them. 
 UCD is essential in the battle against information overload and the law of unintended consequences. Technology is introduced to solve a problem or to improve performance, but this then changes people’s behaviour and new problems may emerge. 
 Originally, email seemed like a wonderful idea – it is cheap, fast, saves paper, and so on. But we are victims of its very success: now people have so many emails that they are overloaded (it is hard to prioritize), to say nothing of spam and phishing, flames and people sending irrelevant or erroneous emails to thousands of recipients. It is now possible for an ill-conceived email to waste thousands of hours when it is send to many staff. Emails are a recognized and growing problem; but the same trend is affecting test results, patient records, drug-drug interaction reports. For all of these reasonable tasks it seems obvious they should be computerized, but doing so often results in increasing amounts of low-level information that can distract people from doing their real job. 
 UCD helps because it emphasizes that no innovation is ever finished: we have to see how it is used, and continually improve it. Email, and the rest, have a way to go, and UCD promotes that at each step we should be user-centred (driven by the needs of users and what they are trying to do) rather than technology-centred. 
 Unfortunately, technology creates new users. Computers need technicians and managers, and these users also contribute to the UCD improvement cycle. However if we are not very careful, the management of the technology gets a life of its own that takes a higher priority that delivering improved patient care. When investments are made, the experts are consulted – but now the experts appear to be the technologists rather than the healthcare professionals or even the patients. This can cause many problems. 
 Systems that are under-performing and hence need improving often induce workarounds by their users. For example, passwords may not work very well, so nurses find ways to get on with their jobs regardless. Unfortunately the people the other side of the computers just see the systems apparently working; they do not see the workarounds or the unintended risks nurses may be creating as they get things to work. When the system is improved, the workarounds are not considered sufficiently, and the new system may have unanticipated problems that even workarounds cannot overcome. The science (rigor) dream (unqualified success) gap 
 X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895 and immediately recognized as having huge potential for healthcare. Only a few years later, one of Thomas Edison’s assistants, Clarence Dally, who had been enamoured with the potential of X-rays died, of cancer because he had been experimenting with them every day ( Figure 1 ). 
 Figure 1. 
 
 Clarence Dally X-raying his hand, from the New York World, August 3, 1903, page 1 (American Newspaper Repository). It is now obvious that X-rays are not risk-free. Every exposure to X-rays helps a patient yet at the same time exposes them to risk; it is now routine to make a careful trade-off between the benefits and risks. Similarly, we now recognize that pharmaceuticals are not magic and risk-free. In fact, we hardly understand how many pharmaceuticals work, and it is routine – in fact, a requirement – to perform the gold standard randomized control trial (RCT) and other forms of careful experiment before allowing drugs to be released to the market for wider use. Despite our best endeavours, we have a growing awareness of worrying and complex side-effects, such as growing antibiotic resistance that has arisen from over-enthusiastic use of antibiotics (not least in animal husbandry). Some of the original miracle antibiotics are no longer effective. 
 Ben Goldacre’s provocative book Bad Pharma documents how pharmaceutical development sometimes side steps best practice, and promotes drugs that have untoward side effects and other problems. 8 For example in a large RCT, some patients may die for unrelated reasons. The question then is what to do with their data; it is very tempting to treat them as if they had survived and had been cured. Another example success bias in the scientific literature: authors of scientific papers want to publish their successes rather than their failures. So the literature under-represents drug trials that fail or uncover unwanted complications. In turn, this means that systematic studies of drug trials cannot get the correct baseline for experiments, since many experiments are not published. Regulation is starting to address this problem. 
 Goldacre makes clear that pharmaceutical development fails scientific standards; yet technology development, such as robotics or computer system development, does not even aspire to the scientific standards that pharmaceutical research is aware it fails to reach. As Goldacre puts it, pharmaceutical R&amp;D is close to immoral; yet technology R&amp;D is ignorant. This is worrying for the future, as technological developments may not be adequately tested, tested without satisfactory controls, and under conditions of vested interests. (Most of the studies arguing Physician Order Entry systems are either good or bad are written by people using the single systems they are publishing about; they are not good science.) New technologies may have unfortunate side-effects or other problems (such as forcing risky workarounds) that nobody has seriously looked for, let alone rigorously assessed. 
 The last paragraph makes a strong claim, but it is justifiable. Modern infusion pumps will have been certified for clinical use, and thus evidently passing the applicable safety tests and standards. Yet modern infusion pumps are driven by computer software ( e.g., in their firmware), which can be modified at will by the manufacturers and parameterized by hospital technicians. Indeed, software is regularly updated to fix bugs and to make minor tweaks. Modifying software can completely change the behaviour of devices. What makes the software control of devices so appealing is that manufacturers can create a variety of devices for different market sectors all on top of the same architecture. Changing the software can change a device from, say, a simple infusion pump to a dose error reduction intelligent pump. But such changes can be made after it has been certified for use, without any further regulatory control. Furthermore, one will struggle in vain to find any scientific literature on the assessment, let alone RCTs, for such devices. It does not exist. On the contrary there is a growing literature on the safety problems of infusion pumps. 9 
 One can hope that the future trends include tightening the culture of technology development. The standards need improving, and the laisse faire culture of contemporary development needs addressing. In many ways, today’s medical technology is at a maturity level comparable to the unsafe at any speed automobile of the 1960s. 10 If we do not address the lax scientific standards of technology development, it is unlikely that future technology interventions will improve safety or other desirable measures of healthcare performance. Human factors 
 The nature of human expertise is that it makes errors likely, 11 and clinicians are highly-skilled experts. To become expert at some process means automating it, doing some or all of the task without continual reference to the wider situation. For example, when you learn to drive a car, you are consciously aware of many factors (such as clutch control), but as you gain expertise, driving becomes automated and you are able focus on higher-level goals. As an expert driver, you may find it seems easy to hold a conversation on a mobile phone, as you now have the spare cognitive resources to do so. Unfortunately if something unusual happens, say if a child runs into the road, you may not be paying enough attention to the situation to take appropriate action – ironically, when you were less of an expert driver, you would have had to pay very close attention to road conditions, and you may not have been driving so fast either! The point is that as new technologies will improve things, we humans will still make errors. 
 Human factors is already a problem today: complicated gadgets induce use errors. There is a balance between the time and effort a manufacturer is going to spend making some technology easy to use (and safe to use ) when the economics of selling the product may not prioritize those qualities. Usually new technology is procured because it promises to improve efficiency or reduce costs; safety is an issue covered by insurance, and is rarely part of the procurement requirements. Regulation requires some basic safety, but the features that sell devices often conspire to make the use of the devices more complex. As we discussed with modes, above, the more features the more complex a device is to use. Yet typically features sell technology, and the difficulty of use is pushed onto problems for the users. If there is an untoward incident, it is much easier to blame inadequate training ( i.e., the user’s incompetence) rather than the complexity of the system being used. 
 Human factors – issues such as situational awareness, tunnel vision, and so on – is a large and important area. There are two questions for the future: how can technology help, and how can technology be improved to be intrinsically safer? 
 How can technology help? 
 In time-pressured environments, humans often suffer from tunnel vision – focusing on the original task and overlooking larger situational awareness. The classic example is intubating a patient. This is a demanding, time-critical procedure. The longer it takes, the more pressurized the clinician is to complete the procedure. Sometimes the patient will get into problems, and a tracheotomy is needed – urgently. Sometimes the clinician is so focused on the intubation that the warning signs are missed, with disastrous consequences. Here, technology can help by using monitoring technologies. Remote monitoring of the patient’s vital signs can enable a trained person out of the pressured environment to make helpful comments: Hi! I can see you have about ten seconds before you need to stop... Such ideas lead to concepts like the electronic ICU (eICU) where a control room monitors perhaps 100 beds. Experience with such technologies has been positive, especially if careful steps are taken to avoid a them and us division between the clinicians doing the work and the clinicians monitoring them. Usually a staff rotation is used, so everyone experiences both sides of the camera. How can technology be designed better? 
 Manufacturers can use better design processes, such as those outlined in standards such as ISO 62366. 7 Doing this effectively is hard work, and with rush to market it is tempting to do the bare minimum, for all the reasons discussed elsewhere in this article. Here we can mention three useful ideas: 
 Discovering use errors takes a long time, and this conflicts with rapid entry to market. The solution may be to design systems so that they can be improved in the field. This is actually easy – firmware is routinely upgraded for bug fixes anyway. What needs doing is logging device use in sufficient detail so that the manufacturer gets a good insight into how the device is being used or is failing to be used. Currently, this information rarely gets back to manufacturers in a useful form. 
 Many use errors follow predictable patterns. So-called post-completion errors are common and hard to eliminate just by improving human procedures. A nurse may use a blood glucometer to measure a patient’s blood sugar levels. The nurse moves on to the next patient, and then puts the blood glucometer in a docking station to upload all readings. As described, at this point the nurse has failed to make a written note of the levels on the patient’s paper notes, yet because the device has docked, it has discarded all recordings. This is a post-completion error: the nurse made the error after they had finished. The solution is to redesign the technology, and there are many options here. Why delete uploaded data, for instance? Why not have a reminder in the device to confirm the nurse has recorded data before taking another reading? Why record manually on paper patient notes anyway? This is an example of how the standard operating procedures combined with built-in technological assumptions induce errors (which in this case are unprofessional, and perhaps disciplinary offences), but more thoughtful design can avoid them. Physicality 
 The huge leverage computer technology brings, because it is virtual and can do anything with information (and hence the same piece of technology can be mass produced for a huge market that has not be preconceived), has a down side. Humans are physical. 
 The problem can be illustrated very simply. In the old days books where physical objects, and they looked and felt different. A well-read book would look worn, and an unread book would look new. You would recognize bookmarks sticking out of books, you could write annotations in the margins, you would know how much you have got left to read before you finish it. You could put a book by the front door of your house to remind you to pick it up in the morning; you could leave a book by your bed so it was ready for next time you wanted to read yourself to sleep. And so on. Now, with electronic readers, all books and documents look the same – like the general-purpose computer they are on. Of course, the computer can create colourful covers and images, but the physical object is always the same: namely, the computer or tablet. 
 In the old days a patient would go to their doctor and get a paper prescription. They would then go round to the pharmacist and get their medicines. One problem with this process was that paper prescriptions were notoriously hard to read, and there was a danger of incorrect dispensing. Today, this process has been computerized. The doctor sends the prescription electronically to the pharmacy, and the pharmacy can dispense the drugs almost immediately. 
 Unfortunately, the patient has lost the physical prescription in this process. They leave the doctor’s appointment carrying nothing. There is nothing to remind them to go to the pharmacy to pick up the drugs. Indeed, pharmacies are now having to dispose of drugs that were efficiently dispensed as soon as they were prescribed but were never collected by the patient. 
 Just as electronic books are a gift to book publishers – because the expensive paper book is replaced with a cheap electronic book, free to reproduce once just one copy has been prepared – increasing use of computers in healthcare is irresistible. X-ray photographs no longer need to be developed, put in folders, held up against viewing screens. They can be emailed. But what they have gained, they have lost in physicality. It may no longer be possible to put an X-ray on a viewer back-to-front (hence causing a left/right error), but it is very easy to look at the wrong patient’s X-ray – because they all look the same without their physicality. 
 Unfortunately physicality is in direct conflict with the driving economics. Pieces of paper are very familiar and we understand exactly how they work, but computer screens are cost-effective precisely because they can display lots of information repeatedly without addition costs. Yet from a safety perspective, the screens all look so similar they may be confused. 
 One solution to this is skeuomorphism: making new technologies imitate old (and hence more familiar) technologies, otherwise known as using the right design metaphor. The example here would be to improve the display so that the paper information being displayed looks more like actual paper – perhaps with torn edges, discolouring if frequently used, and so on. 
 A second solution is affordance: make things look like how they are intended to be used. For example, a cup with a handle has the affordance that encourages you to pick it up by its handle. Particularly in emergencies, people need to know what to do intuitively – and affordance is a key part of design. 
 Thirdly, we can make computers disappear – what is left is a physical object which happens to do something complicated, but it has been made invisible to the user. RFID tags and smart chips can be embedded inside objects so that they can do things and interact with each other, but the object appears to be normal. A nice example is the hotel key card; so far as a hotel guest is concerned they behave just like room keys, but inside some sophisticated cryptography creates a host of benefits – for example, unlike losing a physical key it is not a problem if you lose a key card, and the locks do not need to be replaced. When patients routinely have ID tags embedded in them, many of the current problems of patient barcodes will disappear – no doubt to be replaced by different problems! 
 This article is not the place for a deep discussion on design, 12 but it is important to point out that looking up skeuomorphism or affordance on the internet reveals a huge variety of conflicting opinions. In other words, these ideas are ways to argue about design, not ways to design. One still has to do detailed work to make future technologies successful, regardless of their supposed affordances. Despite having nice words to talk about good design, no future will be an inevitable success. Enhanced and bionic humans 
 Although we have said that human factors will remain a constant for the foreseeable future, there is nothing to stop technology enhancing people. Technology will not be used just to monitor and help make people well, but will be used to make them better – better as sportsmen, as healthcare professionals, or whatever. We already have augmented reality, where surgeons can see an enhanced view of the insides of patients. If patients can have brain implants to enhance their lives (to manage Parkinson, for instance) surgeons will have implants to improve their skills, using robotics to reduce tremor or computers to reduce error. After all, the core of the humble calculator – which reduces drug dose calculation errors – has already shrunk in size from table-top clockwork of 50 years ago to something so small it could be swallowed. Who are the protagonists? 
 Thinking about the future is science fiction. Key to the success of any story is to help the reader identify with the key character; or in the present context of thinking about healthcare futures, are we writing from a patient’s perspective or from a technologist’s, or a healthcare professional’s, or ... the story makes choices, and if the choices align with our own interests the story seems more plausible and persuasive. 
 If the market has developed profitable technologies, it follows that we (you and me) want those technologies. This truism needs emphasizing. Industry stays in business making what we want to buy. Industry is adept at adapting to make what we find irresistible: this is market competition. The manufacturers who are better at seducing us survive and grow. As a consumer, I love iPads (at least I did in 2013), but that does not mean that iPads can do much good in a professional healthcare environment. Should we fill hospitals with iPads? One part of me, the private consumer, says yes, they are wonderful! It is interesting how Blackberries were driven by employers, but iPhones and iPads are being driven by consumers; increasingly the employee is dictating what technology the organization they work for uses. But the other part of me, the clinician, the scientist, the technician, asks for evidence that they will truly improve healthcare. It doesn’t make such a good story for me to say I 
 am not sure ! If I am in healthcare procurement, I have to think very carefully to distinguish what I covet as a consumer from what will actually improve the organization I work for. 
 It is certain that getting evidence, doing experiments (RCTs?) will delay the market, and there will be huge pressures on us to believe in the wonderful visions, rather than in the necessity of careful development. Healthcare is complex, and just throwing technology at it will not in itself change anything usefully, other than costing us a lot of money (which is exactly what the market wants us to do). As we approach the future, we need to learn how to plan our resources much more carefully and experimentally. The subtle cost-benefits of X-rays were not apparent immediately, and they rather ruined the original magical story. 
 People trying to sell us the future will certainly latch into our acquisitive consumer natures – this is who we are as individuals. They are less likely to latch into us as patients or clinicians, and thus – while being an engrossing story – they may miss the point and sell us on technological ideas that do not really improve the world so much as satisfy our consumerist urges. One of the important things science fiction teaches us is that the future will not be populated only by sensible solutions. While we hope for a happy ending, there will be problems and even wicked plans, evil empires and natural disasters to overcome along the way. 
 Who makes the future? 
 The future of healthcare is about the patient (or stopping people becoming patients), but patients are not the main stakeholders in healthcare. Insurance companies, big pharma, doctors, managers, suppliers, builders, governments and many other forces will influence the future. Will innovation help patients or will it be partly to help monitor clinicians delivering healthcare? 
 It is interesting that since hospitals started introducing computers that the ratio of managers to clinicians has steadily increased; it is not totally clear that computers have made delivering healthcare more efficient or safer, but they have certainly increased the volume and turnover of the business. Moreover, now patient records are computerized, with the obvious benefits, there are also problems. To get problems fixed, upgrades have to be purchased, and this can be very expensive. Patient records were once on paper; now they are in proprietary formats, and the manufacturer can lock in the user to their particular system, so buying upgrades – perpetuating the lock in – seems cheaper than moving over to an alternative system. Conclusions: what we need to do 
 If we don’t know where we are going, we won’t know when we don’t get there says the quotable Yogi Berra. The market will surely figure out a way to make money, and technology will advance in miraculous ways. Instead, we need to figure out a way to have healthier and happier patients (and not just treating them as individuals), and to do that we’ve got to focus on integrating technology with culture rather than focusing on technology alone. 
 In my view the key thing is to think clearly. Initiatives like the UK Royal College of Physicians Future Hospital Commission, where thought-leaders – patients and healthcare professionals – have sat down and worked out what sort of future hospital they need are to be commended; 3 more importantly, they have articulated principles, not just specific solutions. Such principles are or should be timeless; we should not plan the future by being technology-driven ( e.g., implementing cloud, nanohealth, etc) but by improving along criteria behind principles (such as improving patient care or staff support). Articulating the principles of the futures we want should be a continual process, not a one-off activity; every day there is a new future to plan, and new discoveries that will change our minds about what is possible and likely. Future planning should be as much a routine part of healthcare as responsive care is. If we don’t know what we need, we will get what is easy and profitable to make; as we emphasized above, what we need and what we want are often confused. 
 Are we making the healthcare future we want? If people from the past suddenly materialized in front of us, we would want to be able to convince them the world is the better place they had hoped for. What stories would they take back to help direct their technological trends and developments? Acknowledgements

Others report that fitness organisations in the private sector a re boomin g (García et al., 2011), and are on the verge of becoming the leaders of leisure installati ons (Datamonitor, 2010). Specifically, Europe is currently the most profitable market that coincides with the incr ease in the number of practitioners (IHRSA, 2014). Within the markets with the highest profitability and number of clients is Spain with more than 5 million practitioners and an expenditure of more than 2 billion dollars annually, placi ng it among the top countries worldwide in expenditure and number of clients (IHRSA, 2016). Sacavém and Corre ia (2009) consider Spain as second with regard to the ratio of market penetration (15.3%) as observed in the growth of the number of facilities and an even greater growth in the membership of fitness centres (European Commission, 2014; García-Fer rando and Llopis, 2011; Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, 2015). Concurrently, however, even t hough this is an industry that boa sts a superior increase in its number of participants, research has sh own that there is a prob lem with loyalty of fitness centre clients (European Commission , 2014; García-Fernández et al., 2014). This brings to the surface a concern that has generated interest in a number of studies regarding customer loyalty, for example, relating the service convenience with satisfaction and future intentions (Chang and P olonsky, 2012; García-Fernández et al., 2017a), quality and satisfaction in Greek fitn ess centres (Theodorakis et al., 2014), in sporting facilities in Cypriot (Tsitskari et al., 2014) and in Canadian fitness centres (MacIntosh and Law, 2015). Undoubtedly , promoting customer loyalty in sport ing services is in line with the promotion of physical activity which would result in lower health problems (J iménez et al., 2015). In the research literature there are few stud ies that examine the many different factors of client perception and its repercussions on loyalty even in countries, as in the case of Spain, where the fitne ss industry appears to be conso lidated while at the same time growing (European Commi ssion, 2014). The manuscript is organised as follows. Se ction 2 reviews the relevant literature on perceived quality, perceived value, satisfact ion and future intentions and the relationships between the variables. Section 3 explains the theoretical model and the hypothesis. Section 4 indicates the design and the m ethodology of the empirical study. Sect ion 5 presents the results of the current study. Finall y, Section 6 provides discussion of the findings and conclusions. 
 Consumer behaviour and sport services 11 2 Theoretical background 2.1 The relationship between perceived quality, perceived value and satisfaction Although there is a dearth of studies geared to ward the ana lysis of the client’s perception in the sporting environment and its relationship to his/her loyalty (Nuviala et al., 2015), quality and value have generated recent interest in the literature, as evidenced in the number of publications on sport organisations, specifically in regards to perceived quality (Pérez-López et al., 2015). In the case of perceived quality, Grönroos (1984, p.37) defines it as “the outcome of an evaluati on process where the cu stomers compare thei r expectations with the service they perceive to have received”, and Zeithaml (1988, p.3) as “the view of the consumer on the excellence or superiority of a product/service”. In the sport sector, Ko and Pastore (2004, p.162) define d it as the “customer´s overall impression about the service performance, service delivery systems, and overall consumption experiences”. Regardi ng the perceived value, Zeitham l (1988, p.14) defines it as the “overall assessment of a product base d on the perceptions of what it receives and what it gives in return”. Later, Oliver (1999) defines perceived value as a positive function of what the client received a nd a ne gative function of what the client sacrificed. On this topic, there are studies that fo cused on the analysis of the relationship between perceived quality and perceived value, finding positiv e, direct, and significant relationships between the variables am ong spectators of sporting events (Calabuig et al., 2010, 2012, 2015). Furthermore, studies oriented to public sport facilities obtained the same results (Jin et al., 2015; Nuviala et al., 2012b), as did studies on general sport organisations (Nuviala et al., 2015; Pitts, 2015; Schwarz et al., 2015) and professional teams (Byon et al., 2013; Pitts et al., In Press). In the same way, research studies within the fitness sector examining client perceptio n showed positive and direct results with regards to the relation of these varia bles (G arcía-Fernández et al., 2017a; Theodorakis et al., 2014). Specifically in this sector, one of the mo st common topics studied is t he connection between perceived quality and satisfaction (Gar cía-Fernández et al., 2014, 2017b) due to specific interest in their relationship (Ros a et al., 2012), there existing a direct and positive relationship between both variables (Dhu rup et al., 2006). In particular, Oliver (1993) indicates that satisfaction is a ps ychological result that emanates from an experience or an emotional response to experiences associated with a purchase (Westbrook and Reilly, 1983). Overall, the more recent research emphasises this relationship within fitness centres in Gr eece (Avourdiadou and Theodorakis, 2014; Theodorakis et al., 2014), Taiwan (Hsueh and Su, 2013), Portugal (Carrizo and Freitas, 2016) and Cyprus (Tsitskari et al., 2014). 2.2 The relationship between perceived va lue, satisfaction and client loyalty Perceived value is a concept that has been slightly li nked to customer satisfaction (Dorai and Varshney, 2012; Pitts and Stotlar, 2013), affirming, according to Cronin et al. (2000) that value influences satisfaction in a positive manner. In the sport environment, the perceived value and customer satisfaction relationship is often considered. Calabuig et al. (2010) and later Calabuig et al. (2012) obt ained positive results from sport spectators 
 12 . García- ernánde et al. with regards to this relationship, coinciding with the studies by Bodet (2012) and Nuviala et al. (2012a), but not with the wor k of Nuvi ala et al. (2015). Alt hough scarce, there are previous studies such are those from M urray and Howat (2002), Theodorakis et al. (201 4) and García-Fernández et al. (2017a) conducte d in centres in Australia, Greece and Spain, respectively, which coincide with confirming a positive, direct, and significant relationship of perceived value and custom er satisfaction. In a like manner, perceived value influences cu stomer loyalty and behaviour intentions (Cronin et al., 2000; Pitts and Stotlar, 2013). In research studies conducted in the sport sector, Theodorakis et al. (2014) and Howat and Assaker (2013) identified an indirect relationship between both variable s in fitness centre and aquatics clients. Similar work includes that of Calabuig et al. (2014) who demonstrat ed perceived value to be the strongest and direct link with regard to client loyalty to public sport facilities. Furthermore, the work of Murray and Howa t (2002) affirms the same in fitness centres in Australia. Additionally, Anderson and Mittal (2000) reported that satisfaction intimately corresponds with attitude since this variable is inclined to predict the intentions of purchase, and thus predict loyalty. In t he sport sector various studies have analysed these relationships (Calabuig et al., 2010, 20 12; Howat and Assaker, 2013; Kim et al., 2006 ). In research regarding centres, the work of Murray and Howat (20 02) stands out. These authors conclude that satisfaction works between perceived quality and loyalty, and this is similar to a study by Alexandris et al. (2004) that addresses the mediation of satisfaction on perceived quality and loyalty. Recently, Theodorakis et al. (2014) and Avourdiadou and Theodorakis (2014) corroborated the direct relationship be tween satisfaction and behaviour intentio ns in fitness centres in Greece. 3 Hypotheses and theoretical model The review of the literature shows a minimal amount of research in rega rd to examining the relationship between perceived quality, perceived value and satisfaction with future intentions of fitness centre clients. More specifically, fitness centres in Spain have not been considered. The literature could be enha nced with such research. Moreov er, fitness centre management professionals coul d benefit from this research. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived quality, perceived value and satisfaction with future intentions of clients in fitness centres in Spain. With this purpose, and based upon the literature review, the following five hypotheses were developed to guide the research: Hypothesis 1 The perceived quality of clients of fitness centres maintains a direct and positive relationship with their perceived value. Hypothesis 2 The perceived quality of clients of fitness centres maintains a direct and positive relationship with client satisfaction. Hypothesis 3 The perceived value of clients of fitness centres maintains a direct and positive relationship with client satisfaction. Hypothesis 4 The perceived value of clients of fitness centres maintains a direct and positive relationship with future intentions. 
 Consumer behaviour and sport services 13 Hypothesis 5 Th e satisfaction of clients of fitness centres maintains a direct and positive relationship with future intentions.

Participan ts in this study were clients of ten fitness centres in Spain. There were 1,805 fitness ce ntre clients of which 55% (993) are female and 45% (812) are male. The size of the samp le was calculated with a 3% error for a level of confidence of 99% ( Z = 1.96). The age of the study’s participants included 7% ( n = 127) less than 20 years of age; 44.1% ( n = 796) between 21 and 40 years; 20.4% ( n = 369) between 41 and 60 years; and 28.4% ( n = 513) 60-plus years of age. With regards to the level of education of the participants, 29.2% ( n = 527) had completed elementary or primary level educati on; 17.9% ( n = 323) acquired secondary or high school level; 18.7% ( n = 337) had professional preparation; and 34.2% ( n = 618) reported a university education, master or doctorate. Wit h regards to occupation, 14.3% ( n = 258) are students; 7.8% ( n = 140) are professionals; 19.5% (n = 352) are employees working for someone other than themselves; l 4. 3% ( n = 77) are self-employed; 14.1% ( n = 255) are unemployed; the ‘other’ category was chosen by 42% ( n = 723) of the sample. Finally, the longevity of the client’s activity with the fitness centre showed 53.9% ( n = 974) of the sample had been clients of the fitness cent re for less than a year; 17.2% ( n = 311) had been with the fitness ce ntre for one to two years; 11. 3% ( n = 203) had been clients for two to three years; and 17.6% ( n = 317) had been clients f or more than three years. 4.2 Instrument A questionnaire instrument was develope d using prior research (Brady and Cronin, 2001; Oliver, 1997; Zeithaml, 1988; Zeithaml et al., 1996 ). The questionnaire included demographic questions and a total of 31 items grouped into two sections. The first section 
 14 . García- ernánde et al. consisted of 15 items proposed by Brady and Cronin (2001 ) to evaluate perceived quality through three dimensions (facility, employees, and programs) in addition to the four items proposed by Oliver (1997) to evalua te q uality in general. The second section consisted of scales to measure perceived value (Zeit haml, 1988), satisfaction (Cronin et al., 2000; Oliver, 19 97), and future intentions (Zeith aml et al., 1996), each one with four items. A nine-point Likert scale with a range f rom ‘completely disagree’ (1) to ‘completely agree’ (9) was used for possible responses. The scales have been used in studies related to the fitness industry (Avourdiadou and Theodorakis, 2014; García-Fernández et al., 2017a; Theodorakis et al., 2014). 4.3 Procedure Data were collected from cl ients using 15 fitness centres in Spain with common spaces including a fitness room, two or more multi-purpose rooms for directed activities, and a space equal to or greater than 1,000 square metres. The researchers contacted the centre s via telephone and offered two m eetings with ma nagers who were interested in the study. This led to ten fitness centres participating in the study. Three meetings were held with the managers and coordinators of each fit n ess centre to explain the objectives and the methodology of the study. In order to not interrupt the daily responsibilities and du ties of the fitness centres, one surveyor was as signed in the m orning and another in the afternoon to collect as many surveys as possible, requesting the participation in the study of each client as they entered the facility. E ach participant took 10 to 15 minutes to complete the survey. Data were co llected during a ten week period. 4.4 Data analysis Two stages were developed us ing the statistical software SPSS and AMOS (v.20. 0, IBM Company) for statistical analysis. Initially, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to obtain the factoria l structure, followed by a co nfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with the objective of confirming the measurement model, utilising a maximum likelihood procedure. The internal consistency of the constructs was calculated through the composite reliability considering adequate values higher than .70 (Hair et al., 2009). To test for internal validity, the average variance extracted (AVE) was estimated to evaluate convergent validity, dem onstrating values higher than . 50 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2009). Discriminant validity was assumed when the value of AVE for each construct was higher than the square co rrelation between that construct and any other (Fornell and Larcker, 198 1). In the second stage, the structural equation model was estimated to prove the research hypothesis, evaluating the predictive validity of the scale of general quality, value, satisfaction, and, future intentions. The adequacy of data for both the measurement and structural model wa s assessed with a variety of goodness-of-fit indexes (Brown, 2006). Specifically, the good fit of the model was assumed with statistically significant ( p &gt; .05) values of chi-square ( χ 2 ), the ratio of the statistic χ 2 to its degrees of freedom was less than 3 (Arbuckle, 20 06), the CFI, NFI, IFI and TLI indexes greater than .90 (Hair et al., 2009) and, lastly, the RMSEA index was considered optimum with a value inferior to .06 and accep table with a value inferior to .08 (Byrne, 2000).

 16 . García- ernánde et al. Results obtained from the CFA for the measurement model indicated a satisfactory fit to the data [ χ 2 (413) = 3,263.69 ( p &lt; .001); χ 2 /gl = 7.90; RM SEA = .06 (CI = .060, .064); CFI = .95; NFI = .94; IFI = .95; TLI = .95]. The statistic χ 2 was significa nt ( p &lt; .001) and its ratio to the degrees of freedom assumed a val ue superior to the recommended criteria of 3.0 (Arbuckle, 2006). Nevertheless, this index has demonstrated to be sensitive to sample size (Hair et al., 2009), the sample size of the present study ( n = 1,805) being large. For this reason, it is important to take into account other indexes, in this regard, the value for the indexes CFI and NFI were higher than the rec ommended threshold of .90 (Hair et al., 2009), indicating an acceptable adjustment of the data. The IFI value, which takes into account the parsimony of the model as the sa mple size, and the TLI value registered a good fit ( ≥ .95). Additionally, the RMSEA index was within the established criteria for good fit of the model (Byrne, 2000). All items showed high factor loadings (&gt; .70), while the Z values ranged from 17.95 to 27.27, thus indicating that each item signi ficantly carries its respective construct. CR resulted in a .88 value for ‘facilities’ and higher than .90 for the rest of the constructs. The convergent validity was satisfactory fo r all the constructs with acceptable AVE values which ranged from .60 (‘facilities’) and .84 (‘general quality’) (Table 1). Descriptive statistics and the correlations be tween constructs are presented in Table 2. ‘Programs’ was the most valued dimension wit h the highest median score ( M = 8.26; SD = 1.30), while ‘facilities’ obtained the lowest mean score ( M = 7.19; SD = 1.49). In general, all constructs demonstrated high levels of valuation above 7.50, with the exception of ‘facilities’. Evidence of discrimina nt validity was accepted to the extent that none of the squared correlations exceeded th e AVE values for each of the ass ociated constructs.

The overall assessment of the structural model showed an acceptable fit to the data [ χ 2 (423) = 3,877.48 ( p &lt; .001); χ 2 /gl = 9.16; RMSEA = .0 67 (CI = .065, .069); CFI = .94; NFI = .93; IFI = .94; TLI = .94] (Hu and B entler, 1999). 
 Consumer behaviour and sport services 17 Figure 2 Structural model of the loyalty ch ain in clients of fitness centres Figure 2 reveals that the three dimensions of perceived quality positively influence general quality, and programs ( β = .44; p &lt; .001) carries more weight, far above facilities ( β = .33; p &lt; .001) and employees ( β = .15; p &lt; .001), and is responsible for 58% of the variance ( R 2 = .58) of general quality. Similarly, correlations between the three dimensions of perceived quality showed significance ( p &lt; .001). For the rest of the variables, general quality ( β = .55; p &lt; .001) and value ( β = .35; p &lt; .001) were positive and significant predictors of satisfaction, which at the same time demonstrated a strong relationship with future intentions ( β = .86; p &lt; .001). General quality also demonstrated a significant relationship with value ( β = .68; p &lt; .001), as well as the relationship established between value and future intentions ( β = .04; p &lt; .04). Finally, the relationships established offer an ele vated percentage of the variance of the depe ndent variables. In this case satisfaction and future intentions are above 60%, and the variance value displayed 46%. 6 Discussion The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between perceived quality, perceived value, and satisfaction with future intentions in clients of fitness centres in Spain. Specifically, the present study expands the literature with regards to the relationships of these variables within a sport context. Its importance lies in the dearth of studies related to the fitness industry offering novelty in the field of sport consumer 
 18 . García- ernánde et al. behaviour. The findings suggest, according to the variables analysed, that clients of fitness centres in Spain perceive programs and employees positively, but have a lower perception of facilities. These results could be due to the lack of investment in the design of space in these sporting facilities resu lting in a poor perception of them. Notwithstanding, it must be highlighted that satisfaction as well as behaviour intentions (Zeithaml et al., 1996) demonstrated high scores that undoubtedly ind icate a positive behaviour. Considering the first hypothe sis, the findings from consumers of fitness centres note a direct and positive relationship between pe rceived quality and perceived value. The results obtained from the present study supp ort previous work with different consumers of sport organisations (Calabuig et al., 2010, 2012, 2015; Nuviala et al., 2012a, 2012b , 2015) and in Greek and Spanish fitness centres (García-Fernández et al., 2017a; Theodorakis et al., 2014). Specifically, one of the strengths of this research study is to ratify this relationship in Spa nish consumers, so that in the general sector clients, who perceive a quality sport service, will also ha ve a positive perception of value. Therefore, when a client perceives the service offered by an employee, the sport activity, or the equipment to have optimal quality, he/she will also perceive a positive valu e. Likewise, the results obtained are in agreement with previous work in fitness centres from different countries with regard to the relationshi p between perceived quality and satisfaction (second hypothesis). Furtherm ore, Avourdiadou and Theodora kis (2014), Hsueh and Su (2013), Theodorakis et al. (2014) and Tsitskari et al. (2014) found that the greater the perceived quality, the greater the satisfaction of the client. Therefore, the findings of this study corroborate the analysis in the same industry but concerning different countries. This appears to strengthen the relationship of these variables in consumers of fitness centres. In relation to the third hypothesis, di fferent studies on sport consum ers had revealed the relationship between value and satisfacti on (Bodet, 2012; Calabuig et al., 2010 , 2012; Nuviala et al., 2012a), and this is supported by the results in this study. However, in the case of the work of Nuviala et al. (2015) the results did not corroborate this relationship, suggesting a heterogeneous consumer sample that perhaps results in the lack of a relationship between both variables since att itudes change according to the sport service. Yet, the results from the current study indicate a positive relationship in Spanish customers of fitness centres, exactly as set out in the work of Murray and Howat (2002), Theodorakis et al. (2014) and García-Fernández et al. (2017 a) with the same typology of consumer, indicating that satisfaction is a cons equence of fitness centre clients’ perceived value. Therefore, the importance of percei ved va lue appears to be present as long as there is a positive relationship with future intentions or loyalty as expressed by Calabuig et al. (2014) and Theodorakis et al. (2014) guaranteeing the fourth hypo thesis of this study. Accordingly, a client with a positive perception of value will be a client who is more than likely to be loyal. Recently, findings in studies by Avou rdiadou and Theodorakis (2014) and Theodorakis et al. (2014) indicated a positive relationship between satisfaction and loyalty in clients of fitness centres. Prec isely, the findings of the current study corroborate this relationship in consumers of fitness centres in Spain, thus supporting the fifth hypothesis offered in this study. T herefore, it could be indicated that clie nts of fitness centres in Spain are satisfied with th e services received, have a positive attitude, and consequently will be more loyal. 
 Consumer behaviour and sport services 19 6.1 Implications Lastly the current study seems to affirm that if a fitness centre consumer has a positive quality perception of the centre, this can influence the perceived value and his/her satisfaction, thus resulting in a more loyal client. For this reason, it is considered important for those responsible for fitness centres to continually evaluate their consumers. Loyalty will depend on their percep tion of such variables as quality, valu e, and satisfaction. In particular, managers of fitne ss centres must carry out a correct management of the three factors analysed in this study. In fact, the facilities, the employees and the programs are decisive in the loyalty chain of the clients of these sports facilities. Thus, the correct management of human resources and physical activity programs will influence a positive perception of quality. Likewise, cleaning care, the attractiveness of the facilities and the good conditions of the equipment and the environment, should be of particular atten tion, as they will influence the consumer’s perception. Thus, if clients perceive a positive quality of these factors, they will obtain a positive perception of value, thus reducing the monetary and non-monetary sacrifices associated with this variable (Oliver, 1999). Likewise, as has been shown, the con tinuous analysis of the perceived quality of the customer will help determine the degree of consumer satisfaction. Precisely, the findings showed that perceived quality influences satisfaction so managers must properly manage t heir resources to achieve high levels of satisfaction. In short, the greater the perc eption of quality, value and satisfaction, the more loyal will be the customers of the fitne ss centres. Therefore, if the Spanish fitness industry is considered a world reference (IHRSA, 20 16), the results obtained are especially valuable for this sector and c ould be used to improve custom er loyalty for consumer of fitness centres in other parts of the world. 6.2 Conclusions, limitations and future research In conclusion, this study has revealed the positive relationship between perceived quality, perceived value and satisfaction, with futu re intentions. In fact, perceived qu ality influences perceived value and customer satisfacti on in fitness centres. Likewise, perceived value positively influences satisfaction, also influencing both variables in the client’s future intentions or loyalty. However, this study has certai n limitations . A limitation of the current study was the convenience invitation for fitness centre participation in the study although this is the most commonly used recruitment method in this type of study. On the other hand, conducting a transversal study of quantitative nature could be considered as restrictive for the study. Along this same line, to analyse lo yalty with measures of subjective b ehaviour could result in measures that are not comp letely representative of customer loyalty although it is the most commonly used instrument in the majority of related investigations. Given these points, future studies should consider including fitness cen tre associations or federations in order to ac hieve a heterogeneous and larger sample size of fitness centres. The use of a longitudinal design and qualitative methodology would help achieve a deeper understanding of the c ons umers of these services, allowing for the management of loyalty data as well as fre quency of use, longevity in the facility, and client recommendations. As it stands, this type of study is in its beginning stages, affording numerous investigative opportunities.

 ... A partir del conocimiento de las relaciones entre estos constructos, se pueden establecer modelos que ofrezcan una mejor comprensión de las actitudes de los clientes al disfrutar posteriormente del servicio (Prado-Gascó, Calabuig, Crespo, &amp; Núñez-Pomar, 2018). De este modo, el gestor deportivo podrá dar respuestas a sus necesidades, objetivos y expectativas, consiguiendo su fidelización (Bernal-García, García-Fernández, Grao-Cruces, Teva-Villén, &amp; Nuviala, 2018; García-Fernández, Gálvez-Ruíz, Pitts, Vélez-Colón, &amp; Bernal-García, 2018; Montesinos, Vegara, Morales, López, López, &amp; Angosto, 2018;Haro, Pérez-Ordás, Grao-Cruces, Nuviala, &amp; Nuviala, 2018b). ... ... Los resultados del estudio señalan que existe una relación directa y significativa entre la calidad y el valor percibido en todos los grupos del estudio, datos que están en consonancia con otros estudios que relacionan percepciones con variables sociodemográficas de edad y sexo (García et al., 2017;García-Fernández et al., 2016;Haro, 2018;Pérez-Ordás et al., 2019). Si comparamos los resultados con otros trabajos en los que no se hace mención al sexo y edad de los clientes, los hallazgos de este estudio mantienen la línea de los de investigaciones anteriores (Nuviala et al. 2015; García-Fernández et al., 2018; Montesinos et al., 2018). ... ... La calidad del servicio se ha confirmado como un antecedente de la satisfacción (Álvarez et al., 2019;Berber &amp; Mollaoðullar1 ,2020;Barshan et al., 2017;Molina-García &amp; González-García, 2018;García-Pascual et al., 2016;Haro et al., 2018b) constatando que el valor percibido tiene relación directa con la satisfacción, actuando como predictor (Theodorakis et al. 2014;Molina-García &amp; González-García, 2018; García-Fernández et al., 2018; García et al., 2020;Nuviala et al., 2020). La relación entre las tres variables estudiadas reprodujo correctamente el modelo propuesto por Murray y Howat (2002) en usuarios de servicios deportivos que realizan actividades físicas organizadas. ... Los gestores deportivos buscan conocer las percepciones e implantar programas que garanticen la satisfacción y continuidad de los clientes, debido al incremento de práctica de actividad física y de la competitividad de los servicios deportivos. Objetivo: constatar la existencia de diferencias en el modelo que relaciona calidad, satisfacción y valor percibido en función del género y la edad de los usuarios de actividades deportivas organizadas. Método: 1.654 personas (44.9 % mujeres), con una edad media de 32.52 ± 14.70 años participaron en el estudio. El instrumento utilizado fue el cuestionario EPOD2 y como pruebas estadísticas se realizaron análisis exploratorios, correlaciones, alfa de Cronbach, AVE, FC, invariancias factoriales y coeficientes de regresión. Resultados: La valoración de la actividad fue positiva, siendo la satisfacción la percepción más puntuada, seguida por valor y calidad. Las mujeres valoraron mejor el servicio, encontrándose diferencias significativas por género en la valoración de calidad, y diferencias significativas en función de la edad y sexo en la evaluación de valor. La calidad tiene relación directa y significativa con el valor, siendo ambos conceptos un antecedente de la satisfacción. Conclusiones: el usuario de actividades deportivas organizadas tiene una percepción muy positiva del servicio. Las mujeres valoran en mejor medida la calidad y el valor. A menor edad, menor estimación del valor. Los resultados del estudio justifican el establecimiento de estrategias de gestión para la mejora de la calidad y valor percibido con el fin de satisfacer y fidelizar al cliente. Abstract. Sports managers try to understand customer perceptions and to implement programmes that guarantee clients satisfaction and continuity, because of the increase in the practice of physical activity and the competitiveness of sports services. Objective: to determine the existence of differences in the model that relates quality, satisfaction and perceived value according to the gender and age of the users of organized sports activities. Method: 1.654 people (44.9% women), with a mean age of 32.52 ± 14.70 years participated in the study. The instrument used was the EPOD2 questionnaire and exploratory tests, correlations, Cronbach's alpha, AVE, composite reliability, factorial invariances and regression coefficients were used as statistical tests. Results: the activity assessment was positive, with satisfaction as the highest rated perception, followed by value and quality. Women rated the service better, finding significant differences by gender in the assessment of quality, and significant differences according to age and sex in the assessment of value. Quality has a direct and significant relationship with value, both concepts being an antecedent of satisfaction. Conclusions: the user of organized sports activities has a very positive perception of the service. Women rate quality and value more highly. The younger the age, the lower the value assessment. The results of the study justify the establishment of management strategies for the improvement of quality and perceived value in order to satisfy customers and build customer loyalty. ... In this context, the relationship among satisfaction, perceived value, and future intentions is a recurring issue in the service literature in general (Cronin, Brady &amp; Hult, 2000) and in the sports management literature in particular (Kwon, Trail &amp; Anderson, 2005). More recently, interest in this subject has shifted to the study of service quality and user satisfaction in sport facilities (Baena, Gálvez, Sánchez-Oliver, &amp; Bernal, 2016; García-Fernández, Gálvez-Ruíz, Pitts, Vélez-Colon, &amp; Bernal, 2018; Tsitskari, Tsiotras, &amp; Tsiotras, 2006). Such interest arises from the influence of consumer satisfaction on the benefits associated with speaking well about the company, cross buying or customer loyalty (Anderson, Fornell and Lehman, 1994). ... ... According to the literature, satisfaction has a direct effect on consumer loyalty (Chang, Wang, &amp; Yang, 2009), which involves several dimensions, such as positive WOM, reduced price sensitivity and repurchases (Anderson et al., 1994). In this sense, numerous studies have observed how satisfaction has a direct effect on intention (Cronin &amp; Taylor, 1992;Price &amp; Arnould, 1999;Wangenheim &amp; Bayón, 2007), and some of these studies have been focused specifically on sport management (Calabuig, Burillo, Crespo, Mundina, &amp; Gallardo, 2010;Cronin et al., 2000; García-Fernández et al., 2018; Prado-Gascó, &amp; Calabuig, 2016;Trail, Anderson, &amp; Fink, 2005). ... ... As already stated at the beginning of the paper, customer satisfaction is a recurring issue in the marketing literature (Gil &amp; Gallarza, 2008), even within the sport services literature (Bodet &amp; Bernache-Assollant, 2011; García-Fernández et al., 2018; García-Pascual, Silla, Mundina, &amp; Escamilla, 2016;Tsitskari, Tsiotras, &amp; Tsiotras, 2006) largely due to the implications of these variables for sports management and the viability of the company as a whole (Anderson, Fornell, &amp;Lehman, 1994;Martín-Consuegra et al., 2007). The relationship among satisfaction, perceived value, and future intentions is a recurring theme and has been extensively tested (Cronin, Brady, &amp; Hult, 2000;Kwon, Trail &amp; Anderson, 2005;Tsitskari, Tsiotras, &amp; Tsiotras, 2006). ... The relationship among satisfaction, perceived value, and future intentions is a recurring theme in the service literature. Traditional models in sports management have not studied the indirect effect (moderation) of instructors on activities in the aquatic environment or the effect of satisfaction with instructors. For this reason, the objective of this study is twofold: on the one hand, it aims to analyze the moderating effect that aquatic
activities with an instructor has on management variables, and on the other hand, it seeks to observe the moderating effect of the satisfaction with this instructor on the rest of the variables. The study sample consisted of 424 users, aged 18 to 84 years, (M=48.57, SD=14.21; 58.3% female (247)), obtained by an intentional sampling among the users of the public aquatic facilities from a town in the Valencian region (Spain), Paterna,
during the 2016-2017 season by trained personnel. Data were obtained through a self-compliant instrument composed of an ad hoc question regarding type of activity (“free swimming” or “guided water activities”) and other scales that measure service perception of user. Based on the results obtained, there only seem to be significant differences in perceived value depending on the type of activity (free swimming vs guided aquatic
activities). Taking into account the moderating effect of the type of activity, it is only observed in the effect of general user satisfaction on future intentions, with a greater effect in the case of free swimming than in the case of guided aquatic activities. Along the same lines, the results suggest that there is no moderating effect of satisfaction with the instructors on any of the relationships established. ... This study showed that the Quality of FI is important for pregnant women who practice physical exercise in a group class program for this population, reinforcing the importance of these professionals in the Quality of the service and consequent satisfaction of participants and adherence to the practice. 28 Pregnant women in this study value the quality dimension of FI, being Relational Quality slightly more valued than Pedagogical-Technical Quality. Pregnant women seem to appreciate the quality dimensions of the FI similarly to the general population of apparently healthy adults. ... Introduction
The exercise professional’s role is to provide proper exercise prescription and selection, regular feedback, positive reinforcement, and behavioral strategies to enhance adherence. Thus, knowing the preferences of the consumers will enhance pedagogical skills.
Objective
To characterize pregnant women’s preferences regarding the fitness instructor’s quality characteristics in specific group exercise sessions for this population.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted in 2021. The Fitness Instructor Quality Questionnaire was applied to 29 pregnant women engaged in prenatal group fitness classes, aged between 24 and 48 years. This questionnaire includes 25 items, grouped in two dimensions, scored with a Likert scale with 7 levels of importance (1 = not at all important; 7 = extremely important). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize pregnant women’s opinion (mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum).
Results
The global average of items was 6.41, showing that pregnant women give importance to the Quality of the fitness instructor. Relational Quality has the highest average (6.48), close to Pedagogical-Technical Quality dimension (6.34). The most important items for pregnant women were Ethics (6.76), Communication (6.72), and Availability, Motivation, and Punctuality (6.69). The less important items were Musical Domain (5.24), Image (5.69), and Physical Fitness (5.86).
Conclusion
Pregnant women give great importance to the Quality of the fitness instructor, although they value some indicators more than others, as identified in other studies in different populations. Considering the results of this study, it can be recommended that fitness instructors delivering prenatal exercise programs should address these factors related to Quality. It can be emphasized that the fitness instructor should have an intervention that shows willingness to listen to pregnant women, allows them time to perform the exercises, encourages them to practice, without overestimating aspects related to image or fitness level. ... Satisfaction and service quality have also shown a direct and positive correlation in different studies. Such investigations state that service quality precedes user satisfaction [30] and, despite the lack of thorough research on this relationship in the EI context, such a correlation has been investigated in other contexts, such as sports [31] and transportation [32]. ... Early Intervention (EI) is a set of interventions focused on responding to the needs of children with or at risk of developmental problems. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between the perceived quality of service, satisfaction and family quality of life.
Methods:
to conduct a multi-centre, transversal study with a non-probabilistic sample. The participants (N = 1551) were families from 24 Early Intervention Centres (EICs) located in Spain.
Results:
The results indicated an adequate fit of the measurement and structural models, with the latter showing a capacity of 73% to predict the family quality of life. The structural model established that the perceived service quality was a positive and significant predictor of satisfaction (β = 0.85; p &lt; 0.001). Both the perceived quality of service (β = 0.28; p &lt; 0.001) and satisfaction (β = 0.33; p &lt; 0.001) obtained a similar positive and significant relationship with family quality of life, which was slightly stronger than satisfaction.
Conclusions:
This study provided a better understanding of the importance of the services offered in EICs and their influence on the satisfaction and family quality of life of their users. Thus, delving into these relationships was highly relevant for decision-making in the context of EI. Summar Alfredo Gómez Barrios Purpose
This study aims to assess service quality in sport child camps among both participants and parents and its effects on satisfaction and behavioural intentions.
Design/methodology/approach
Data were collected from participants (n = 258) and parents (n = 226) of a sport child camp. A confirmatory factor analysis analysed the psychometric properties of the constructs, and a subsequent structural equation model examined the effects of service quality on satisfaction and behavioural intentions.
Findings
The results indicate a multi-dimensional construct of service quality that influences satisfaction and behavioural intentions differently among parents and participants. For participants, Service Failures and Recovery, Safety and Food influenced satisfaction, while Service Failures and Recovery and Fun influenced Behavioural Intentions. For parents, Management Commitment to Service Quality, Staff, Food and Contact with Physical Environmental influenced satisfaction, while Management Commitment to Service Quality and Staff influenced Behavioural intentions.
Research limitations/implications
Both parents and participants' perceptions of service quality in sport child camps were captured and its effects on satisfaction and behavioural intentions. The study provides sport child camp managers with critical information about service delivery and its outcomes among the two key consumers (participants and parents).
Originality/value
This study offers new ideas to advance knowledge on sport child camps by capturing the perceptions of two key stakeholders and providing useful insights into how different attributes of service quality influence the levels of satisfaction and behavioural intentions among parents and participants. This paper aims to investigate the effect of family firms’ characteristics on millennials’ purchase intention through three dimensions (emotional appeal, product and service quality and corporate social responsibility) in the context of online shopping. Since millennials are the first digital native cohort, this research aims to understand the moderating role that digital savviness plays in influencing millennials’ purchase intention. Data have been collected through an online survey of a representative group of 502 millennials and have been analysed using linear regressions. This study identifies which family firms’ characteristics positively influence millennials’ purchase intention and demonstrates that the moderation effect of digital savviness positively impacts this generation only through electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and peer-to-peer reviews. It contributes to the extant literature on family business and consumer behaviour by deepening the effects of family firms’ characteristics on this specific generational cohort, which represents the next most relevant generational cohort after the boomers. The purpose of this study was to investigate athletic donors' (behavioural, normative, control, recognition) beliefs, behavioural attitude, recognition attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and behavioural intention toward financially supporting green stadium initiatives (GSI) in an intercollegiate sport setting, and the relationships among the variables. Research participants were athletic donors (N = 114) of a collegiate athletic program located in the southeastern U.S. An online survey was conducted to measure the specified variables. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that donation intention toward GSI was influenced by donation attitude and social norm, while recognition attitude and perceived behaviour control were not relevant. The discussion is focused on establishing educational programs to elevate donor beliefs in GSI, foster positive attitude, and enhance supportive norms KEYWORDS Green stadium initiatives; Theory of planned behaviour; Athletic donation; Environment; College sport facility _______________________________________________________________________________________ Brenda Pitts The World Association for Sport Management (WASM) was founded to facilitate sport management research, teaching and learning excellence, and professional practive, across every continent. The WASM book series is designed to support those aims by presenting current research and scholarship, from well-established and emerging scholars and practitioners, on sport management theory, policy, and practice. Books in the series will explore contemporary isues and key challenges in sport managment, and identify important new directions for research and professional practice. Above all, the series aims to encourage and highlight the development of international perspectives, international partnerships, and international best practice in sport management, recognizing the globalized nature of the contemporary sport industry. Antonio Carrizo Moreira Pedro Silva In recent years, in the services market, we have witnessed a growing importance of concepts such as service quality, satisfaction, word-of-mouth and complaint behaviour. The proposed conceptual model aimed to examine the existing relationships among these dimensions in the context of health clubs. Data was collected through questionnaires and analysed using structural equations modelling (SEM) to simultaneously test all the relationships in the model. Overall, the results suggest that quality is assessed through staff, programme and facilities evaluation, and that service quality is crucial for both satisfaction and word-of-mouth generation. Customers do not complain to third parties, i.e., to external parties that are not involved, but have some influence on the service provider even when low quality is delivered or they are dissatisfied. Claes Fornell David F. Larcker The statistical tests used in the analysis of structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error are examined. A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model. The aim of the current study is to assess the total quality of the municipal sports services of Alcalá la Real, analyzing the three dimensions of quality service: functional, emotional and tangibles. The sample is composed of child users, contact personnel (attention personnel of the users and coaches) of the municipal sports facilities, sport coordinator of the town council and the parents of the children the different sports. The qualitative methodology has used for the content analysis. The instrument used for data collections are individual interviews and focus groups filmed with a video camera. For content analysis we used the Atlas.ti 7.1.3 software. According to results tangibles were very important for child users when they evaluat the total quality of the sports services and the emotional aspect were also found to me more important than the functional quality of service. Organizations strain to understand their clients' needs in order to satisfy them adequately and achieve competitiveness. As a result, a change is underway in the area of sports management that consists in creating specific measures for the quality of client satisfaction and services. This is the context of this study, the main goal of which is to determine the dimensions of the quality of the sports service offered by football clubs. To this end, a questionnaire was applied through the personal survey method. The data obtained was processed by an exploratory factorial analysis. The results allow for the identification of ten basic dimensions of the quality of the sport service analyzed. [Citation: 36]

 Are you struggling to keep your sports facility running smoothly and efficiently? You’re not alone. Managing a sports facility requires a fine-tuned balance of staff coordination, maintenance, and customer service, all while ensuring the safety and satisfaction of athletes and fans. 
 Sports facility management is an essential yet complex field dedicated to the seamless operation of sports and recreation facilities. From the majestic arenas that host thousands to the intimate gymnasiums where local communities gather, these spaces require meticulous attention to detail and a broad skill set to manage effectively. 
 The importance of sports facility management cannot be overstated. It is the backbone that supports the thrill of the game, the safety of participants, and the satisfaction of spectators. It encompasses a wide range of responsibilities, including but not limited to staff management, event planning, financial planning, marketing, and ensuring the highest standards of safety and cleanliness. 
 
 In the paragraphs to follow, we will dive into the nuts and bolts of sports facility management, helping facility and operations managers like you find innovative, technology-driven solutions to streamline processes, enhance guest experiences, and tackle the challenge of maintaining cleanliness and operational efficiency with real-time data and analytics. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or new to the field, this guide aims to illuminate the path to excellence in sports facility management. 
 Understanding Sports Facility Management 
 When we talk about sports facility management , we’re diving into the heart of what keeps sports venues – like stadiums, gymnasiums, and arenas – running smoothly. It’s all about the blend of facilities, management, operations, and maintenance working in harmony. Let’s break these down for clarity: 
 Facilities 
 This term refers to the physical locations where sports activities occur. Think of the vast array of places: everything from massive stadiums hosting thousands of fans to local gymnasiums where community basketball games take place. Each of these places requires attention to detail to ensure they’re ready for action. 
 Management 
 Here’s where the human element shines. Management in sports facilities involves coordinating all the moving parts – staff, schedules, events, and more. It’s about making sure that the right people are in the right place at the right time, and that everything runs according to plan. 
 Operations 
 Operations are the day-to-day activities that keep a sports facility ticking. This includes everything from opening the doors in the morning to turning off the lights after the last event of the day. It involves logistics, event setup and teardown, and much more. 
 Maintenance 
 Lastly, maintenance is crucial. This is the work that ensures facilities are not just operational but safe and welcoming for athletes and spectators alike. It covers cleaning, repairs, and regular checks to prevent any issues before they arise. 
 At TRAX Analytics , we understand the importance of each of these components in sports facility management. We provide technology-driven solutions that help facility managers oversee operations and maintenance with ease. By leveraging real-time data and analytics, our clients can ensure their facilities are not just meeting but exceeding expectations. This approach allows for:

 Proactive Maintenance : With real-time data, potential issues can be identified and addressed before they become problems. 
 
 Sports facility management is about creating an environment where athletes can perform at their best, and fans can fully enjoy the spectacle. It’s a challenging and rewarding field, requiring a mix of skills in logistics, people management, and technology. At TRAX Analytics , we’re proud to support sports facility managers in their quest to achieve excellence. 
 Types of Sports Facilities 
 In sports, a wide variety of facilities serve as the backdrop for training, competitions, and recreational activities. Understanding the different types of sports facilities is crucial for effective sports facility management. Here, we’ll explore the main categories: Training Centers, Gymnasiums, Stadiums, Sports Federations, and Universities. 
 Training Centers 
 Training centers are specialized facilities designed to offer athletes the space and equipment needed for rigorous training routines. These centers focus on athlete development, offering a controlled environment for skill improvement, strength training, and rehabilitation. They are equipped with specific tools and machines tailored to various sports disciplines. 
 Gymnasiums 
 Gymnasiums, often found within community centers or schools, are versatile indoor facilities that host a range of sports activities, including basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, and more. Gymnasiums are characterized by their hardwood floors, marking for different sports, and equipment like hoops and nets. They serve not just athletes but the community at large, providing a space for physical education classes, recreational leagues, and local events. 
 Stadiums 
 Stadiums are large-scale outdoor or indoor facilities designed to accommodate a significant number of spectators for major sporting events. From football and baseball to track and field, stadiums host a variety of sports, often featuring expansive seating, large fields or pitches, scoreboards, and state-of-the-art sound systems. Managing a stadium involves complex logistics, from crowd control to maintaining the playing surface. 
 Sports Federations 
 Sports federations are not facilities per se but often operate their own dedicated spaces for the administration of a particular sport. These can include training venues, offices, and even small-scale competition areas. Federations play a crucial role in the development of athletes and the regulation of their respective sports, ensuring standards are met across all related facilities. 
 Universities 
 Universities represent a unique category, as they house multiple types of sports facilities within a single campus. From collegiate stadiums and gymnasiums to aquatic centers and training complexes, university facilities support a wide range of athletic programs. They serve student-athletes, faculty, and sometimes the local community, making their management multifaceted and intertwined with educational objectives. 
 At TRAX Analytics , we understand that managing these diverse types of facilities requires tailored solutions that address their unique challenges and opportunities. Whether it’s optimizing the cleanliness of a gymnasium or enhancing the safety protocols of a large stadium, our technology-driven solutions aim to support facility managers in creating optimal environments for athletes and spectators alike. By focusing on real-time data and analytics, we help streamline operations, improve guest experiences, and ensure facilities are not just venues but landmarks of athletic excellence. 
 
 In the next section, we’ll delve into the key responsibilities of a sports facility manager, highlighting the vital roles they play in the successful operation of these diverse sports environments. 
 Key Responsibilities of a Sports Facility Manager 
 Sports facility management is a big job. It covers everything from making sure the place runs smoothly to keeping everyone who uses it safe and happy. Let’s break down what this involves. 
 Staff Management and Leadership 
 First, there’s looking after all the people who work there. This means: 
 
 Hiring the right people who are excited to be there and have the skills needed. 
 Training them so they know exactly what to do and how to do it the best way. 
 Scheduling their shifts so there’s always the right number of people around when they’re needed. 
 
 Budgeting and Financial Management 
 Next, we have to talk money. This part is all about: 
 
 Budget Planning to make sure there’s enough money to do what needs to be done without wasting any. 
 Expense Tracking to keep an eye on where the money’s going and make sure it’s spent wisely. 
 Financial Performance Optimization to make the most of the facility’s finances, finding ways to save money and maybe even make more. 
 
 Marketing and Public Relations 
 Then, there’s getting the word out. This includes: 
 
 Promotions to let people know what’s happening and why they should come. 
 Media Relations to make sure the facility gets good press and the public hears good things. 
 Image Enhancement to keep the facility looking good in everyone’s eyes, making it a place people want to be part of. 
 
 Customer Service Excellence 
 We can’t forget about the people who use the facility. This means: 
 
 Making sure Patron Satisfaction is always high by providing great service and listening to what they need. 
 Feedback Management to learn from what people say about their experiences and find ways to make things even better. 
 Experience Enhancement to make sure everyone has a great time, every time they visit. 
 
 Safety and Security Protocols 
 Last but not least, keeping everyone safe. This involves: 
 
 Policy Implementation to have rules in place that protect everyone who comes to the facility. 
 Emergency Preparedness to be ready for anything that might happen, with plans in place to handle it. 
 Facility Inspections to regularly check everything is as it should be, fixing any problems before they become dangers. 
 
 At TRAX Analytics , we understand how challenging these responsibilities can be. That’s why we offer solutions to help manage them more effectively, using real-time data and analytics to improve operations, enhance guest experiences, and ensure safety and security. With our help, sports facility managers can focus on what they do best — creating an unforgettable atmosphere for athletes and spectators alike. 
 The Importance of Facility Management in Sports 
 When we discuss sports facility management , we’re really talking about ensuring three critical factors: safety, financial performance, and the experience of athletes and spectators . Each of these elements plays a crucial role in the success and sustainability of sports venues. Let’s break down why each factor is so vital. 
 Safety 
 First and foremost, the safety of everyone who steps into a sports facility cannot be overstated. From the athletes competing to the fans cheering them on, and even the staff working behind the scenes, everyone deserves a secure environment. This includes regular maintenance to prevent accidents, adherence to building codes, and emergency preparedness. Our approach at TRAX Analytics emphasizes the use of data to anticipate and mitigate risks before they become issues. 
 Financial Performance 
 A well-managed facility is also a financially successful one. Efficient operations can significantly reduce costs, while also maximizing revenue opportunities. For example, streamlined janitorial operations can lower expenses, while data-driven strategies can optimize the scheduling of events to ensure maximum attendance. By leveraging real-time analytics, we help sports facility managers make informed decisions that boost the bottom line. 
 Athlete and Spectator Experience 
 Lastly, the experience of those using the sports facility is paramount. For athletes, a well-managed facility means better training and competition spaces, which can enhance performance. For spectators, it’s about comfort, convenience, and enjoyment — factors that encourage repeat visits. From ensuring clean restrooms with our janitorial management software to optimizing concession stand operations, our solutions aim to elevate the overall experience. 
 In conclusion , effective sports facility management is about much more than just keeping the lights on. It’s about creating a safe environment, ensuring financial viability, and providing a memorable experience for everyone involved.

 BOOK REVIEW Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events Daniel C. Funk Oxford: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, 247 pp., j 29.40, ISBN 978-0- 7506-8666-2 This book is part of a Sport Marketing Series and focuses on the understanding of consumer behaviour in sport and events and related adapted marketing strategies and actions. The book comprises three parts articulated around 12 chapters. The first part opens with an introduction and a definition of Sport and Event Consumer Behaviour (SECB), which may represent the first attempt to define, bound and give unity to this research object. It then emphasizes the uniqueness of the sport and event product which appeals to specific marketing strategies and actions. In chapter 2, the author describes the sport consumer motivation process and introduces the SportWay motives which represents a set of five core needs and benefits provided by sport and are labelled with the acronym SPEED (Socialisation, Performance, Excite- ment, Esteem, Diversion). In chapter 3, the author analyses the sport decision-making sequence which provides the foundations for understanding why individuals initially choose and continually engage in sport consump- tion activities. This description of the decision-making sequence is a necessary step to development of an understanding of the Psychological Continuum Model (PCM) (Funk &amp; James, 2001, 2006), a larger framework for understanding a consumer’s psychological connection to a sport object, also presented in this chapter. The first section of the book ends with a fourth chapter which identifies the four marketing actions defined by the author as: (1) strategic use of marketing mix, (2) selection of key target markets, (3) study and evaluation of the market and (4) selection of information systems. In the discussion of consumer segmentation (second marketing action), the author provides a way to practically categorize sport consumers according to the four stages of the PCM framework based on the measure of the different facets of consumer involvement. The second section of the book identifies the features of each stage of the PCM framework and provides adapted marketing actions for each of them. In chapter five, the author analyzes the drivers, processes and outcomes of sport object awareness and identifies sport-related marketing actions in relation to life-cycle positioning. Chapter six focuses on an analysis of the attraction stage and specific marketing triggers, such as social, cause-related, sponsorship and Internet levers. The following chapter describes the ISSN 1618-4742 Print/ISSN 1746-031X Online DOI: 10.1080/16184740903554181 European Sport Management Quarterly, Vo l. 11, No. 2, 193  195, April 2011 Downloaded By: [Bodet, Guillaume][Loughborough University] At: 08:22 4 May 2011 
 attachment stage, which is the next level of commitment in the PCM and identifies, for instance, personalization, self-concept and customized bond- ing as appropriate marketing concerns for this stage. Chapter eight cor- responds to the last stage of the PCM framework and deals with the characteristics and specific marketing actions of the allegiance stage. Finally, chapter nine identifies the main constraints to sport event consumption in general and moves to a next stage in the PCM framework in particular, and provides some elements to minimize these constraints through marketing actions. The third and final section of the book comprises chapters 10  12, which provide an extensive practical checklist articulated around three areas (i.e., administration services, facilities and support services, and special events and services) to organize a sport event. As the author suggests, this book targets industry professionals and advanced students interested in the delivery of sport and event products and services. The reader might require a minimal knowledge of sport consumer behaviour and/or marketing because it is largely based on academic knowledge and research publications in this field, which is one of its major positive qualities. It refers to a range of seminal and cutting-edge publica- tions, which makes the book a great source for those wishing to develop a grasp of the sport consumer area. Moreover, the strong research basis is not an obstacle to non-specialists. The quality of the writing, the numerous figures and concrete and ongoing examples help the reader to make links between concrete sport consumer examples, theory and the practical marketing actions required for implementation. In this regard, the identifi- cation of numerous marketing levers in relation to the sport consumer’s level of commitment in the second section of the book, as well as the sport event organization guide in the final section, constitute accurate orientations and tools for sport managers. Despite the fact that this attempt to comprehend sport consumer behaviour as a whole is laudable, nevertheless this type of approach has some limitations. Indeed, as acknowledged by the author himself, sport consumer behaviour is a complex phenomenon due to the wide scope and the heterogeneity of sport as a consumption object, and the cultural and contextual differences between various forms and sites of consumption. One might wonder, therefore, whether a single framework can accurately embrace all or most of the forms of sport consumer behaviour. From a theoretical point of view, the allocation of consumers to the four stages of the Psychological Continuum Model may be subject to discussion, but its relevance from a managerial point of view can easily be seen. A final observation is that the concepts of consumer satisfaction and value could have received greater attention with regard to their place in the marketing literature in general and the sport marketing literature in particular. Overall, this book is well written and structured, with a clear attempt to make its contents accessible to the reader. It is generally successful in meeting the difficult challenge of simultaneously satisfying academics and students, by providing an extensive and well-referenced account of sport 194 BOOK REVIEW Downloaded By: [Bodet, Guillaume][Loughborough University] At: 08:22 4 May 2011 
 consumer behaviour, and practitioners by linking this knowledge to appropriately specified marketing strategies and operations. For these reasons, it represents an excellent resource to tackle the complexity of sport consumption and achieve managerial objectives. References Funk, D. C., &amp; James, J. (2001).

 ResearchGate has not been able to resolve any citations for this publication. Prior research has demonstrated a direct relationship between loyalty and reasons for liking a particular sport team. The current study replicates and extends this line of inquiry by examining the mediating role of attachment, a process by which an individual moves from merely liking a team (attraction) to becoming loyal to a team (allegiance). Data (Collegiate N = 194; Collegiate and Professional N = 402, Favorite Sport Team N = 808) were collected to examine 13 benefits and attributes associated with liking a sport team, 3 attitude formation properties, and allegiance. A three-stage test of mediation using MLR revealed that attachment mediated the relationship between allegiance and Vicarious Achievement, Nostalgia, Star Player, Escape, Success, and Peer Group Acceptance. Results demonstrate that allegiance is the outcome of a process by which individuals develop stronger emotional reactions to, more functional knowledge about, and greater symbolic value for benefits and attributes associated with a sport team. Research on sport spectators and sport fans is examined to develop a model of the psychological connections that individuals experience with sports or sport teams. The Psychological Continuum Model (PCM) is introduced. It provides an extended view of sport spectator and sport fan involvement, and outlines general parameters that may mediate the relationship between an individual and a sport or team. The PCM provides a framework that may account for an individual's movement from initial awareness of a sport or team to eventual allegiance. Four levels are described and differentiated: awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance. The model proposes that the psychological connections between an individual and a sport or team are governed by the complexity and strengthening of sportrelated mental associations. The PCM provides a model that integrates current research and suggests new directions for future research and applications. [Citation: 38]

Abstract
This paper will examine different aspects related to correctional recreation with the intent of
establishing that it is a valuable tool and should be continually implemented in prisons. A multitude of
sources and studies were researched and used to provide the information. The history of recreation in
correctional settings is presented as well as the types of recreation that have been made available in
institutions across the country. The benefits and goals of correctional recreation are then examined. These
benefits include physical and psychological gains, increasing institutional safety, as well as reducing
recidivism. The role recreation plays in institutions is also discussed. Problems facing correctional
recreation are reported, including views surrounding recreation in institutions, budget issues, and
problems with participation. Also examined are suggestions to improve correctional recreation and
reasons why it should be present in institutions. The evidence introduced in this paper substantiates the
idea that correctional recreation is beneficial to inmates and should not be eliminated from prisons.

Introduction
Today, more than 2.3 million people are currently incarcerated in the American Criminal Justice
System. “These people are spread between 1,719 state prisons, 102 federal prisons, 942 juvenile
correctional facilities, 3,283 local jails, and 79 Indian Country Jails as well as military prisons,
immigration detention facilities, civil commitment centers, and prisons in the US Territories” (Wagner &
Rabuy, 2017, p. 1). Even though these people have committed any number of crimes, they are still
entitled to recreation privileges.
While there is no federal law providing for mandatory recreation privileges, it is generally
accepted that not providing these privileges (or withholding those privileges for extended periods of time
or for arbitrary reasons) is a violation of prisoner rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United
States’ Constitution (Farber, 2008). The Eighth Amendment prohibits the use of cruel and unusual
punishment. Prisoners might also have additional or more specific rights under state or local regulations
or a correctional facility’s own policies and procedures (Farber, 2008). Many of these ideas and court
rulings came out of the belief that the goal of incarceration should be rehabilitation instead of punishment
(Robertson, 2000).
This paper will explore different topics related to recreation in correctional institutions. Research
shows that recreation plays a crucial role in the offender rehabilitation process because it keeps inmates
occupied, increases institutional safety, is cost effective, limits inmate trips to the infirmary, and teaches
prisoners vital skills needed for reentering society.
The History of Correctional Recreation
In the early part of the eighteenth century, prison life was intended to be punitive. Reverend
Sydney Smith stated that,
In prisons which are really meant to keep the multitude in order and be a terror to all evil
doers, there must be no sharing of profits — no visiting of friends — no education but
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 4
religious education — no freedom of diet — no weaver’s looms or carpenters benches.
There must be a great deal of solitude; coarse food; a dress of shame; and incessant,
irksome, external labor; a planned and regulated and unrelenting exclusion of happiness
and comfort. (Caplan, 1996, p. 14)
Prisoners were expected to be reformed through a regimen, becoming penitent, and complying with
prison regulations. This method did not help with recidivism. Instead, it appeared to increase the inmates’
likelihood to continue committing crimes by further deteriorating them mentally and physically. North
American penal systems began to reform by making humanitarian changes to ease the burden of prison
regimes and holding a more positive view of rehabilitation. Introducing sports in prisons served both of
these purposes (Caplan, 1996).
While much of the history of correctional recreation is unknown, by the 1840’s, some prisons
would celebrate holidays with entertainment on occasion. Initially, leisure was the only form of recreation
available. Leisure consisted of guards relaxing the stringent rules within the institution (Caplan, 1996).
In 1870, the first National Prison Association Congress reviewed and approved a resolution
that identified the goal of prisons as rehabilitation. Prior to this resolution, prisons were seen as having a
primary function of punishing those convicted of committing crimes and protecting society (Robertson,
2000). During the 1870’s, leisure time was expanded to some prisons giving inmates yard time, but only
during national holidays. Special occasions provided the opportunity for other activities such as music,
theater, and lectures at select prisons. Eventually, the limited yard time inmates were allowed developed
into half-holidays in which prisoners organized games spontaneously (Caplan, 1996).
The first institution to develop a formal sports program for inmates was Concord Reformatory
in Massachusetts. Prison authorities allowed for several clubs and societies to be formed. They thought
that these organizations would offer inmates practice in self-governance. One of these societies was the
Baseball Society. There were forty-five members and they held regular meetings. Prisoners could play
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 5
games such as baseball, wrestling, and football on Saturday afternoons. Eventually, neighboring cities
would send teams to play against the reformatory teams. Following this model, Elmira Reformatory in
New York introduced organized sports to their institution in 1896 for the purpose of fostering self-control
and team spirit (Caplan, 1996).
These types of programs were extremely controversial at the time. Sports programs such as
these did not spread into the adult prison system until the early part of the 20th century. By 1915, sports
programs had spread to prisons in the Mid-West, Northeast, and Southwest United States. The reason for
the change was not because prison officials suddenly realized the worth of recreation, but solely to
attempt to control the prisoners in masses. When recreational sports programs became prevalent in the
United States’ prison system, the primary accomplishment was their entertainment value (Caplan, 1996).
Between this and 1960, there were no notable changes in prisons. However, political
developments in the 1950’s changed the “hands-off” approach previously taken by courts in reference to
the prison system. Prior to 1960, courts refused to touch litigation connected to prison reform. This
“hands-off” policy allowed prison administrators to operate without any judicial interference. The courts
followed this approach due to beliefs that “separation of powers, lack of judicial expertise, and fear of
undermining prison discipline justified staying out of prison matters” (McCall, 1981, p. 40). Changes in
politics in the 1950’s changed the belief that the “hands-off” approach was best. Due to the prison riots,
inmate lawsuits against state prisons, the progressive movements of the 1960’s, and the civil rights act the
attitude of the judicial system changed (McCall, 1981). Some federal courts began using the Eighth
Amendment to force prison officials to improve inmates’ living conditions (Lee, 1996). During this
rehabilitative phase in the United States prisons, there was an increased use of recreational programming.
Several recreational sports programs were developed throughout the United States’ prison system
(Caplan, 1996).
However, the driving force behind many prison changes was the riot at Attica prison. Attica was a
maximum-security prison located in New York which held 2,200 inmates. In 1971, prisoners at Attica
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 6
rebelled, taking hostages to attain their demands. They stormed through the institution beating prison
guards, acquiring improvised weapons, and even burning down the chapel. The state police were called in
to help regain control of the prison. They were successful at recovering most of the prison, but 1,281
prisoners still occupied one of the prison yards. They held 39 prison guards and other employees hostage.
This went on for four days. Police attempted to negotiate with the inmates, but it was ineffective.
Eventually, state police and prison officers raided the yard, during which 10 hostages and 29 inmates
were killed and 89 others were critically injured (Thompson, 2016).
Many prison professionals found that a lack of recreation was partly to blame, as inmates had no
way to blow off steam and too much idle time to plan riots. The National Recreation and Parks
Association got involved through one of their branches, the National Therapeutic Recreation Society
(NTRS). In 1971, shortly after the Attica riots, the NTRS, during their annual conference, formed a task
force to examine correctional recreation and conduct an educational forum on the subject. They became
more involved every year. In 1972, they held a conference in Virginia for people in the correctional
recreation field and a separate two-day conference covering correctional recreation topics. They also
published an article, partook in a special committee that they were appointed to by the Governor of
Georgia, consulted the Virginia State Prison System, and participated in the conference held by the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons. After this, in 1973, they were asked to evaluate the jail recreation programs in
Washington, D.C. and make recommendations for the new correctional facility that was being built. The
NTRS also participated in a conference with the Ohio Department of Corrections, which was held for
administration and recreation staff. Unfortunately, the NTRS disbanded in 1974 due to lack of
professional interest. However, before they separated they made significant headway in proving that
correctional recreation should be present in prison systems (Calloway, 1981).
Additionally, by 1970, prison law had become a specialty. Politicians began to pay more attention
to prisoners’ living conditions and the courts began to rule in favor of prison reform (McCall, 1981).
Since then, the role of recreation in correctional institutions has been debated. Some felt that prisons
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 7
should be for punishment and that recreation should not be made available. Other people considered
recreation to be a means to increase inmate productivity and control behavior. Still others thought that
recreation was essential to keep inmates’ minds occupied. No matter what the motive was, by the end of
the century many prisons offered a range of recreation opportunities (Robertson, 2000).
Types of Recreation Available
To understand the different types of recreation available to inmates, we first must define what
constitutes as recreation and leisure. Both terms are assumed to be interchangeable, however there are
subtle differences. Leisure is generally thought of as the spare or free time that during which one can do
whatever they wish to (Roberts, 2001). Compton and Hormachea define leisure as “a block of unoccupied
time, spare time, or free time when we are free to do what we choose” (1979, p. 11). Recreation can be
defined as “the use of time for amusement, entertainment, participation, or creativity, and frequently takes
place in one’s leisure time” (Compton & Hormachea, 1979, p. 11). Recreation includes activities whose
purpose is to bring joy, fun or excitement (Roberts, 2001). These activities are often pleasurable and are
not taken part in out of necessity or for material rewards (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). Recreation can
also be classified as either passive or active. Active recreation occurs when an individual actively
participates in an activity that requires mental or physical effort to a substantial degree. Active recreation
includes activities such as playing sports, playing an instrument, gardening, and crafts. Passive recreation
occurs when someone is the receiver or consumer of entertainment by other people or activities. Passive
recreation activities include watching television, listening to music, reading, and playing computer or
console games (Roberts, 2001).
Presently, all correctional institutions provide some degree of access to recreational activities.
Sometimes, these programs are referred to as Leisure Time Services (LTS). Programs are available for
inmates of different ages, sexes, security levels, and mental capacities (Polson, 2002). In a survey
conducted in 1981 of correctional institutions in the United States, approximately fifty percent of the
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 8
institutions provided sports activities such as basketball, softball, volleyball, and weight training (Caplan,
1996). Northpoint Training Center in Burgin, Kentucky, an adult male, medium-security institution,
offers intramural softball, basketball, volleyball, corn hole, horseshoes, a weight room, a band room with
instruments, a cardio room, pool tables, ping pong tables, and a library, among other activities
(Commonwealth of Kentucky, 2016). Another example of a facility that provides LTS is the Kentucky
Correctional Institute for Women (KCIW), which is an all-level, adult female institution in Pewee Valley,
KY. The KCIW offers both indoor and outdoor activities such as movies, individual video workouts,
pool, tennis, video games, team sports, arts and crafts, and musical instruments (Commonwealth of
Kentucky, 2016). The Wyoming Department of Corrections, in their policies and procedures, outlines
different opportunities for recreation that can be offered. Outdoor recreation and exercise activities
include basketball, volleyball, flag football, soccer, softball, and others. Indoor recreation activities
include board and card games, leisure time activities, gym time, weight room, a hobby room, and movies
(State of Wyoming, 2008). As is evidenced in the examples, institutions offer a variety of recreational
opportunities to inmates.
However, these offerings can vary greatly between institutions. “Different budget levels,
mandates, facilities, equipment, and staffing levels and staff skills result in some institutions having a
wide range of activities, while others provide more basic activities” (Polson, 2002, p. 8). For instance,
Kentucky State Penitentiary (KSP) located in Eddyville, Kentucky, is an all-male, maximum security
prison. It would not be able to offer the same activities as a minimum-security facility for safety reasons.
Likewise, Kentucky State Reformatory (KSR) mainly handles inmates with varying degrees of mental
health issues. KSR would have to be just as cautious as Kentucky State Penitentiary when choosing
appropriate activities for its inmates due to the likelihood of them causing self-harm with whatever they
could find, such as metal or plastic pieces from broken equipment. These issues are generally addressed in
the institution’s policies and procedures. For example, the Wyoming Department of Corrections’ Policy
and Procedure #5.300. This policy covers inmate recreation and activities and establishes a
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 9
comprehensive recreational policy with approved recreation activities and the process for getting
additional activities authorized. This policy outlines both outdoor and indoor recreational activities. This
policy also defines general rules for recreational activities that must be followed (State of Wyoming,
2008). Generally, the two limiting factors on what recreation is provided in each institution are safety
issues and the resources available to the institution.
No matter the institution, three distinct categories of programs can be identified. Although, not all
three can be found at every institution, due mainly to differing resources and ideologies. These three
categories are activity-focused programs, reformative activities, and reintegration activities. Activityfocused programs further the goal of keeping inmates busy - such as board games, art, and sports.
Reformative activities focus on providing knowledge and skills such as educational, substance abuse, or
life skills programs. Reintegrative activities prepare inmates for life after prison such as assistance
obtaining housing, medical services, and counseling (Braxton-Mintz, 2009). Some institutions also offer
“Leisure Counseling,” which is described as a “helping process which facilitates interpretive, affective,
and/or behavioral changes in others toward the attainment of their leisure well-being” (Compton &
Hormachea, 1979, p. 26). Leisure Counseling attempts to achieve several goals including leisure resource
guidance, fostering lifestyle development and preventative counseling, and providing therapeuticremedial and normalizing experiences (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). At the center of leisure counseling
lies leisure education classes and leisure counseling sessions which help offenders make valid choices
about how to use their leisure time. There are also long-range goals. These include helping prisoners
prepare to re-enter society by making the value of leisure clear and allowing them to gain a better
understanding of themselves. Leisure counseling programs help inmates to select which activities suit
their individual interests and allow for greater self-direction when making leisure choices in the future
(McCall, 1981). However, since this is a relatively new concept, it has not been widely utilized. Most
institutions simply offer a list of activities to inmates from which they can choose to participate.
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 10
The types and amounts of recreation provided also depend on the inmate’s legal status. Per
Robert Lee of Pennsylvania State University, pretrial detainees must be considered innocent of any crime
and therefore their conditions cannot be used for punishment. These detainees are also protected by the
due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment. If a pretrial detainee challenges the institutions recreation
policies, they have more ground to stand on because they are still deemed innocent of any crime.
However, once convicted of a crime, due process clauses are not applicable and these prisoners must turn
to the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (Lee, 1996). This
is important because it determines the legal basis for how much recreation is provided. It also comes into
play when inmates challenge their living conditions or recreation opportunities.
As previously stated, there is no law guaranteeing prisoners’ rights to recreation. Being idle does
not violate a person’s Eighth Amendment rights. However, courts have recognized that remining idle for
long periods of time can have an incapacitating effect. Consequently, they consider this “harmful
idleness” to be cruel and unusual punishment (Lee, 1996). These rulings have resulted in a general
standard; “that inmates are entitled to five hours of recreation per week” (Lee, 1996, p. 169). However,
this standard is usually only applied to long-term confinements. Additionally, prison officials can revoke
recreation rights provided they have just cause.
Also, while courts have determined that inmates must be given recreation time, they have not
specified what constitutes recreation. In other words, the prisoners do not have a right to specific types of
recreational activities. While courts have ruled that allowing inmates to walk the hallways was
insufficient recreation, they have not instituted a set of standards for what does constitute adequate
recreation (Lee, 1996). Courts have also ruled that prisoner’s do not have a right to outdoor recreation.
They did state, however, that “some form of regular outdoor exercise is extremely important to the
psychological and physical well-being of the inmates” and that denying outdoor recreation for prolonged
periods of time could constitute cruel and unusual punishment (Lee, 1996, p. 171). Because of this,
decisions about what types of recreation are offered are largely left up to the institutions.

The Goals and Benefits of Correctional Recreation
The “official” ideology of prison sports is that it involves more than just allowing inmates to
escape the monotony of prison life. Correctional recreation allows prisoners to make changes to their
attitudes and behaviors. Recreation programs can help reduce stress, conquer social weaknesses, and
encourage physical wellness. These programs allow inmates to relieve the pressure of life in prison while
also promoting healthy physical, mental, and social abilities. An ideal prison recreation program should
also focus on the overall health of the individual. Additionally, recreation would help to teach pro-social
values, educate inmates, and promote good sportsmanship practices (Caplan, 1996). Under this ideology,
the perfect prison recreation program helps inmates better themselves physically and mentally and allow
them to return to society as a better individual.
Correctional recreation can have roles, goals, and objectives that differ between institutions. For
example, an institution manual from York Correctional provides the following objectives:
• Provide structured positive alternatives which can be used to fill leisure time.
• Provide opportunities for inmates to channel and vent negative feelings of tension
and anxiety into positive productive attitudes.
• Relieve institutional stress (staff and inmates).
• Improve individual self-esteem.
• Improve health and fitness levels.
• Improve individual creativity (mental and physical).
• Improve positive socialization skills.
• Keep inmates occupied and reduce idleness. Improve athletic and artistic skill levels.
• Educate inmates of various game and sport rules and strategies. (National
Correctional Recreation Association, 2004)
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 12
These general objectives can also be found in a study conducted by Marcia J. Carter and Kelly J. Russell.
They determined that recreation allowed inmates to
Develop acceptable outlets for stress, identify activities that serve as alternatives to
addictions, foster interpersonal skills such as trust, cooperation, and teamwork, enhance
self-esteem through realizing success with a given pursuit, increase access to new social
environments, foster new interests, negotiate constraints, develop awareness of personal
needs and appropriate avenues to satisfy them, develop decision-making and problemsolving skills, and develop new interests, which could evolve into a career. (2005, p. 81)
These same goals are listed by Brenda J. Robertson in Leisure Education as Rehabilitative Tool
for Youth in Incarceration Settings in the Journal of Leisurability. Additionally, even though prison is
used as a method of punishment, prisoners still maintain certain rights as a part of society. These are the
main motivation for making recreation programs accessible to prisoners. These programs have the ability
to enhance inmates’ self-actualization, self-esteem, self-worth, while also enabling constructive
reintegration into society post-release (Caplan, 1996).
Most institutions do not bother to mention the goals of their recreation programs in their policies
and procedures. These documents are more focused on what is permitted or safety measures that must be
taken when inmates are participating in recreational activities. However, even though they do not
explicitly state their goals, they are present. Kentucky State Penitentiary views recreation as a way to keep
inmates busy, meet the requirements for recreation as set forth by the state, and keep inmates physically
active (Commonwealth of Kentucky, 2016).
Through identifying these goals, an over-all theme is emerging, prisoners benefit from being
allowed recreation time. While recreation time is required, it is more helpful in the overall rehabilitative
process than just keeping inmates from being idle. Recreation allows inmates an opportunity to interact
with others. This is especially true for inmates kept in isolation, protective custody, solitary confinement,
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 13
or restricted housing units. Prisoners kept from interacting with others can suffer from “perceptual
distortions, hallucinations, hyperresponsivity to external stimuli, aggressive fantasies, overt paranoia,
inability to concentrate, and problems with impulse control” (Lee, 1996, p. 172). These psychological
issues can be avoided if the inmate is allowed time to socialize with other people. This time is generally
during recreation. This phenomenon was also noted by James Frey and Tim Delaney. They conducted a
survey through a self-administered questionnaire with a secondary analysis of official data. The survey
was completed by 1770 members of the adult male prison population in five Nevada correctional
institutions. Study results indicated that most inmates participated in passive recreation activities, such as
reading books, visiting other inmates, and watching television (Frey & Delaney, 1996). Compton and
Hormachea (1979) recognized that an outcome of recreation was that it promoted a sense of belonging,
encouraged social interaction, and reduced loneliness and boredom. These results suggest that making
friends and constructing social relationships are the main outcome of leisure participation (Frey &
Delaney, 1996).
Recreation can lead to increased self-esteem, which is another psychological benefit provided. To
some inmates, playing sports can be an important factor in what it means to be masculine. Therefore,
playing sports develops and maintains self-esteem. One inmate said,
Through sports you learn how to interact with other people and learn how to obey the
rules and, you know, good self-image and I think there's a lot of positive aspects of it.
With anything you know there's going to be positive and negative but I think the positive
outweighs the negative. (Caplan, 1996, p. 99)
This idea was not limited to one inmate. Peter Perkins’, an inmate, attitude was changed after he was
imprisoned. He stated,
I think sports is really good for a person's self-esteem for a number of reasons. One, if
they are any good at the sport, then that inevitably raises their self-esteem. They get in
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 14
with a group of people and anytime in their life they've had a hard time getting in with
groups of people or becoming part of a group, then that's something that will make them
feel better. (Caplan, 1996, p. 99)
Another benefit is that recreation provides inmates with time to be productively occupied. A
saying among prison officials is “we can keep the inmates busy, or they can keep us busy.” This stems
from the fact that inmates will find ways to relieve themselves of boredom. “If they don’t have things to
occupy their mind then obviously there's going to be other things occupying their mind, like what bank
they're going to rob when they get out or things along that line” (Caplan, 1996, p. 97). This is also
evidenced by Compton and Hormachea, who state that “More concern has been expressed over the
prospects of a misused leisure, and unless government and citizen groups take steps to prevent it, much…
leisure will be wastefully, if not harmfully, used” (1979, p. 26). In fact, being unproductive during leisure
time could be a contributing factor that landed some individuals behind bars. Brenda J. Robertson (2000)
notes that,
Among the inmates of correctional institutions there are many who have no knowledge or
skills which will enable them to make acceptable use of their leisure... They cannot play,
they do not read, they have no hobbies. In many instances, improper use of leisure is a
factor in their criminality. Others lack the ability to engage in any cooperative activity
with their fellows; teamwork is something foreign to their experience. Still others lack
self-control or a sense of fair play; they cannot engage in competitive activity without
losing their heads. If these men are to leave the institutions as stable, well-adjusted
individuals, these needs must be filled; the missing interests, knowledge, and skills must
be provided (p. 27).
This lack of knowing how to use free time can sometimes result in harmless activities such as
reading, drawing, or sleeping. However, some of these “boredom-relief activities” could be lethal or
illegal, such as gambling, making shanks, or doing prison tattoos. Keeping inmates productively occupied
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 15
allows prisoners to fend off boredom and have less time to focus on dangerous activities (Braxton-Mintz,
2009). Arnie Caplan found that
Offenders who experience nothing but hard time are less amenable to counselling,
direction, and behavioral change than those offenders whose free time is spent in a
positive manner .... Recreation will continue to serve as a bridge between hard time and
free time for those offenders who wish to use it. (Caplan, 1996, p. 51)
Recreation keeps inmates productively occupied while also teaching them how to make acceptable use of
their free time post-incarceration.
In conjunction with keeping inmates occupied in a productive manner, recreation also allows time
for them to release negative or “pent-up” feelings; serving as a “safety valve” that allows inmates to
displace aggressive tendencies in a productive and acceptable way (Frey & Delaney, 1996). This was also
noted by Gallant, Sherry, and Nicholson, who stated that “participation in sport and recreation programs
in prisons provides inmates with an opportunity to blow off steam and escape the monotony of the prison
routine” (2015, p. 4). The rationale behind this is that if an inmate expends energy playing sports or
weightlifting, they are less likely to assault a prison guard/correctional officer or another inmate. In an
article entitled “Playing the Game on Sing Sing’s Field,” Laws stated that
While prisoners are taking their turn on the field; while they argue about
their favorite heroes on the diamond or on the gridiron; while they
discuss the salient points of a noted ring event or exchange ideas on
politics or any other topic of common interest, they are not talking about
their "cases"; they forget about length of sentences; they have no time to
brood about emotions. They are, during those hours, normal human
beings with normal interests. (Caplan, 1996, p. 25)
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 16
Because of this, tension levels within correctional institutions can be kept at a reasonable level by
allowing the inmates outlets for their feelings of frustration, hostility, and aggression. Terry Tate, an
inmate, said
You may be having a bad day and inside you play floor hockey… It's great, it's a lot of
fun. Say you were having a bad day, you go there you may get hit, you hit a few guys.
It’s all clean, it’s all in fun and after the game you're just totally drained, you go back to
your cell, get a good night's sleep, you wake up and it’s another new day... It’s a good
frustration reliever. I guess it’s the best way to put it. If they didn’t have sports, I’d be in
a lot longer probably. A lot of guys take part in it and it’s an escape for them. (Caplan,
1996, p. 93)
Lowered conflict and tension levels can help ensure the safety of the prison (Frey & Delaney, 1996). This
was also the view of a Correctional Officer, Harry Hogan. He stated,
You need exercise programs, you need sports programs in an institution for the inmates
to let off steam, to release anxieties, and to participate as groups and to cooperate, to
share, and work as a team. If proper equipment is worn, for example, hockey helmets in
hockey, no one will get hurt by rough play. It will just be guys letting off frustration.
(Caplan, 1996, p. 96)
This was supported by the findings of a study conducted by Roy Hunter. He conducted a study of crime
rates in prisons and correlated the findings to recreation budget levels. During the study, the average
expenditure (per day) for recreation dropped $20.00. After this budget cut, institutional crime rates
increased. Study findings indicated that almost ninety percent of the days before the budget cut showed
no crime. This changed after the budget cut, with only seventy-five percent of the days showing a similar
crime rate as before. He even examined other variables that could have contributed to the increase in
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 17
crime (time of year, medical expenditure, etc.) and concluded that none of these influenced the
budget/crime relationship (Hunter, 1986).
Recreation can also provide an incentive for inmates to maintain good behavior. Gallant, Sherry,
and Nicholson noted that “correctional administrators routinely use sport and recreation… as a hook to
promote appropriate behavior” (2015, p. 4). Inmates who were allowed access to recreation reported that
they felt it was a reward, while inmates denied access considered it a punishment (Gallant, Sherry, &
Nicholson, 2015). If inmates can only participate in recreation based on their behavior, they are highly
motivated to align their behavior with the standards set forth by the administration. Recreation activities
can provide staff with a way to reward inmates for positive behavior and, at the same time, impose
penalties for negative behavior (Braxton-Mintz, 2009).
Perhaps one of the most recent discoveries about correctional recreation is that it can help reduce
recidivism rates. This is achieved through combining several benefits of recreation. Improving self-image,
physical health, and mental health can contribute to an inmates’ effective release. Also, recreation can
provide constructive recreation skills, improve relationships with inmates’ families, afford outlets for
frustration and aggression, and cultivate leadership skills. These positive qualities can contribute to a
stable readjustment into society (Caplan, 1996). The National Correctional Recreation Association
(NCRA) maintains that recreation can “engender socially acceptable attitudes and contact among the men,
and arouse the interest of the inmates in recreation to an extent that they will continue this type of activity
following their release from prison” (Frey & Delaney, 1996, p. 81). Williams, Walker, and Strean (2005)
also noted that leisure education could be used to isolate activities that serve as substitutes to addictions,
foster interpersonal skills, increase access to different social environments, develop problem-solving
skills, and learn how to address personal needs appropriately. They also perceived that it is possible to
replace the “thrill” of committing crime in some young offenders with needs for sensation-seeking
experiences, with specific high-risk recreation activities (Williams, Walker, & Strean, 2005). The idea
that recreation can help reduce recidivism rates can be linked to the concept of desistance, meaning “to
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 18
cease.” Data shows that prisoners that participate in recreation programs are generally well-behaved and
non-violent individuals. Perhaps, if inmates continue participation in organized sports post-release, they
may maintain good behavior and steer clear of future criminal activities (Caplan, 1996). Gallant, Sherry,
& Nicholson (2015) believed that gaining something of significance or meaning can help a person to end
their involvement in criminal activity by creating a desire to change their behavior. These things that hold
“significance or meaning” can be as simple as new relationships. It can be argued that “inmate
participation in sport could promote the development of socially accepted identities and assist in building
more positive social networks with those outside the prison setting, such as coaches and program
volunteers” (Gallant, Sherry, & Nicholson, 2015, p. 3). Recreation can aid in the rehabilitative process
and lower recidivism rates by teaching the inmates productive alternatives for leisure time and getting
them involved with a different group of people.
Recreation also allows prison staff to gain knowledge of the prison climate. Guards and
correctional officers are able to “get a feel” for the atmosphere by watching how prisoners separate
themselves during recreation and leisure time. For example, if the staff notices that inmates are grouped
by race, then the likelihood for conflict rises. Conversely, if the groups are integrated, there is a
probablility that the climate is less hostile. Staff can also assume that if interactions are amicable, the
hostility is low. Observing these patterns allows staff and administrators to identify potenital conflict
within the prison (Frey & Delaney, 1996). Data suggests that prison recreation plays a major role in
maintaining social control within the prison. Many inmates recognize recereation as helping to keep the
prison calm and under control. Maintaining social control is important to staff, whose job it is to keep
order in an environment that can be potenitally violent. Therefore, if a main priority is social control,
recreation should be an important part of prisoners’ lives (Caplan, 1996).
Recreation is also a way for inmates to remain healthy. It allows inmates to “create a healthy
body in an unhealthy environment” (Gallant, Sherry, & Nicholson, 2015, p. 3). Health benefits include
providing alternatives to addiction, reducing health risks for older inmates, and increasing or maintaining
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 19
the general physical fitness of inmates (Gallant, Sherry, & Nicholson, 2015). For example, older inmates
often encounter “high levels of stress and increased incidence of depression, cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer” (Williams, Walker, & Strean, 2005, p. 59). Recreation and
physical activity can improve physical health and offer protection against these diseases. This can
increase the prisoners’ quality of life and reduce additional healthcare costs (Williams, Walker, & Strean,
2005). However these benefits are not limited to the older inmate populations. Physical inactivity has
been linked to coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Physical activity is also
linked to weight control, which is an important factor in managing a person’s health. The probability that
an inmate will develop these problems lessens for every 20-30 minutes they are involved in vigorous
physical activity (Hitchcock, 1990). Depending on the activity, a prisoner may benefit in differing
degrees. This is due to varying intensity levels and physical exertion (Caplan, 1996). Even those inmates
who participate in moderately intense activities have lower mortality rates than those who are not active.
Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death in the United States, and a positive
relationship has been found between exercise and cardiovascular health. Exercise also helps decrease the
risk of developing “colon cancer, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and
obesity” (Amtmann, 2001, p. 6), many of which affect incarcerated individuals. Physical activity can also
help to relieve or eliminate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Living a non-active lifestyle can be
considered a risk factor for developing these diseases (Amtmann, 2001).
One final benefit to correctional recreation is that it provides inmates with new skill sets. Garrett
Heyns, a warden in Michigan, said,
Among the inmates of correctional institutions there are many who have no knowledge or
skills which will enable them to make acceptable use of their leisure. Most of them lack
the avocational interests of the well-adjusted. They cannot play, they do not read, they
have no hobbies. In many instances, improper use of leisure is a factor in their
criminality. Others lack the ability to engage in any cooperative activity with their
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 20
fellows; teamwork is something foreign to their experience. Still others lack self-control
or a sense of fair play; they cannot engage in cooperative activity without losing their
heads. (Compton & Hormachea, 1979, p. 5)
He continued by pointing out that these skills must be provided for the inmates to become stable,
well-adjusted individuals who are “rehabilitated.” These new skills can be things such as teamwork, trust
and cooperation or more complex skills such as negotiating social, financial, or physical constraints to
recreation. Recreation programs can also offer opportunities for inmates to learn new skills that could
develop into careers post-incarceration. These could be opportunities such as music, art, or drama (Carter
& Russell, 2005). More examples include woodworking, metal-working, or working in the
kitchen/cooking. Additionally, programs such as vocational counseling allow inmates to realize that their
recreation interests can become stable bases on which to build career goals. Sometimes, these interests are
a more stable base than an inmates’ occupational history. Pre-incarceration, many inmates do not realize
that their talents in certain recreation or craft areas that interest them could be possible future employment
opportunities (Caplan, 1996).
The Role of Correctional Recreation
When sentencing an offender, the objectives usually include elements of deterrence,
incapacitation, rehabilitation, retribution and restitution. Incarceration supposedly accomplishes the first
four elements, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and retribution. Recreation is one tool that
institutions use to achieve these goals.
Recreation in correctional settings offers many benefits to inmates. However, not all inmate
attitudes towards recreation reflect these benefits. The way in which inmates view recreation determines
the role that it plays in the rehabilitative process. Mathew McIntosh (1986) conducted a survey to
examine the attitudes that minority inmates hold towards recreation programs and how they relate to
rehabilitation. He surveyed three minority groups; blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. The
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 21
participants were between the ages of eighteen and thirty-seven and were housed in the Oregon State
Main facility. The participants were randomly selected and a total of seventy-five volunteers were
enlisted in the study. There were twenty-five participants from each selected minority group. Overall, the
Hispanic and Native American groups felt that the recreation programs were not effective in aiding to
achieve personal goals. The quality of program management was viewed poorly, and the inmates
therefore believed that management was failing to attain any level of rehabilitation. Respondents from the
black minority group differed in that they believed management could achieve some level of
rehabilitation, however, not with the current programs and setup. All three minority groups recognized
that a lack of facilities, storage space, and care for equipment and facility safety were responsible for the
fact that current recreation programs were not fulfilling the needs and interests of the groups (McIntosh,
1986). Teresita Aguilar and Kelly Asmussen (1989) found these same outlooks. They surveyed 496 male
inmates in a maximum/medium security state penitentiary. Only 172 inmates responded, and seven
questionnaires were unusable. Their results were based on the remaining 165 respondents, or 33 percent
of the population. In their study, inmates identified the reason for recreation programs failing to
contribute to rehabilitation as “poor management of recreational programs” (p. 68).
Most inmates look forward to participating in recreational activities. This is because it provides
an escape from their monotonous lives as prisoners. However, most inmates do not perceive recreation as
a link to the community which they will eventually return to, nor do they see recreation as a way of
finding “personal satisfaction, contentment, or development” (Compton & Hormachea, 1979, p. 9).
Ultimately, these viewpoints do not allow inmates to realize all the benefits that recreation can offer them.
These attitudes could stem from how recreation in correctional settings is currently utilized. In
institutions that implemented a “leisure counseling” program, inmate satisfaction was high and their
views of recreational programs were positive. They were able to see the links to the rehabilitative process
and felt as though the programs were effectively managed. They were also matched with program
offerings they liked or were interested in, increasing their involvement (Compton & Hormachea, 1979).
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 22
Increased involvement in the activities also lead to the inmates reaping more benefits from the
recreational activities than those inmates described in the above paragraphs. It has also been noted that,
currently, recreation is not commonly used with other resources, such as counseling programs. For
example, recreation and drug abuse classes are offered separately and there is no correlation made
between the two. However, recreation can be used to teach drug abusers alternative ways of using their
free time. If the prison could identify the connections and pass this insight to the inmates, both programs
could possibly see an increase in effectiveness (Frey & Delaney, 1996).
Another aspect that determines the role of correctional recreation are the guidelines that
institutions use for recreation. What activities are inmates allowed to participate in? Who determines
these activities? Do these activities change based on an inmate’s security status? The answers to these
questions help determine what role correctional recreation plays in the rehabilitative process. Because
these answers vary between institutions, the role recreation plays differs as well. For example, the
Wyoming Department of Corrections policy and procedure number 5.300 states that “inmates being
housed on a special status such as segregation, protective custody, temporary restrictions order, or other
specialized population housing may have limited recreational opportunities based on their housing or
status” (State of Wyoming, 2008, p. 7). This statement shows that recreation is not equally afforded to all
inmates. While general population inmates might have access to numerous recreational activities, inmates
housed in any special housing could only be offered a narrow selection of recreation. Depending on what
programs they are offered, they could miss out on benefits that recreation provides. The Commonwealth
of Kentucky policy and procedure 22.2 covers recreation and inmate activities. It states that recreation
supervisors will choose activities and post them in a daily schedule (2016). Under this model, inmates
have no say in the program offerings and, therefore, the programs picked might not align with the
interests and needs of the inmate population.
Through these findings, it is evident that correctional recreation does not currently play a vital
role in the correctional setting. Correctional administration might not understand what a crucial role
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 23
recreation can play in the rehabilitation process. Because of this, they are not using recreation to its
greatest potential and they are not motivated to do so. The biggest problem in determining recreation’s
role in correctional institutions is that there has not been a great deal of research on this topic. James Frey
and Tim Delaney also observed this lack of research. They stated that
There is considerable need for additional research into the role of recreation and sport
programs in prison and other correctional settings. Recreation's role in contributing to or
defusing potential conflict among prison groups warrants further investigation. In
addition, it would be important to know the basis on which recreation or leisure groups
form. Does ethnicity, race, type of offense, age, sentencing status, or common leisure
interests become the reason that inmates' associations form in prison contexts? What role
does an inmate's pre-prison leisure experience play in the selection of leisure pursuits in
prison? Are there barriers to leisure participation in prison? Is there a hierarchy of leisure
pursuits that impacts the structure (e.g., who has power) of the general prison population?
There are many questions in addition to these that need to be asked. (1996, p. 87)
Assisting prison administrators in realizing all the benefits recreation has to offer could be beneficial in
allowing them to effectively utilize it. This could allow recreation to play an important and larger role in
the rehabilitative process.
Problems Correctional Recreation Faces
Unfortunately, a multitude of problems plague correctional recreation. These issues begin with
the inmate attitudes. One prisoner was quoted saying, “In its simplest meaning to me, recreation is
anything that provides escape from the monotonous ... regimentation and boredom of prison routine ... the
undeviating monotone of prison life” (Compton & Hormachea, 1979, p. 8). While the inmate looks
forward to recreation activities, they do not understand the link between recreation and the community
they will return to. He also does not view recreation as a means to find personal satisfaction, serenity, or
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 24
improvement (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). As previously referenced, the study conducted by Mathew
McIntosh showed that minority inmates do not view recreation as valuable in the rehabilitation process.
They rejected the idea that current recreation programs fulfilled group interests and needs. Native
Americans who participated in this study felt their creativity was stifled. Blacks felt that family leisure
planning was limited. Ultimately, all three groups viewed recreation as failing to achieve any means of
rehabilitation. It was felt that recreation was not meeting personal goals and it was poorly managed
(McIntosh, 1986).
Overall, inmates feel that leisure and recreation is just a way to pass the time. They mostly
identify poor management as the main reason that recreation programs fail to meet their goal of
rehabilitating inmates (Aguilar & Asmussen, 1989). Additionally, some inmates view recreation as a job.
One inmate who participated in weight lifting was quoted saying that, “To me it's a job. There isn’t much
pleasure involved. On the outside, I’m a mechanic, but in here I lift” (Caplan, 1996, p. 121). He saw his
chosen form of recreation as a part of his survival within prison or a form of self-discipline. Other inmates
agreed and went on to say that sports are more useful for passing the time, not for rehabilitation. While it
wasn’t that they were uninterested in positive changes, they recognized the limitations of recreation.
Another inmate argued that recreation should not be placed ahead of educational programs, and that more
time should be spent learning trades and preparing to find employment post-release (Caplan, 1996). He
believed that
There should be more training in jail. My attitude is that the system is so screwed up.
They program people. As far as I’m concerned, these programs are useless. You have to
say no first then go into the program. As far as I'm concerned, this place offers no trades,
no nothing. There should be a trade where a guy can save a little money, learn something
whether it's electrical, plumbing, anything. Just apprenticeship, learn a little something,
then go out on the street, he’s got a little money and he's got something to go for, he’s got
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 25
a goal.... That's my attitude towards how they should rehabilitate people. (Caplan, 1996,
p. 137)
Other groups that view recreation negatively are prison staff and administration. Many
administrators and legislators think that the only way of reducing crime is making punishments severe
and increasing criminals’ chances of being caught. One warden was even quoted saying
The only hope for reducing the burgeoning crime rate lies in decreasing the expected net
advantage of committing crimes (compared to lawful activities) by increasing the cost
through increasing the expected severity of punishments and the problem of suffering
them. (Caplan, 1996, p. 34)
When this punitive penal philosophy is followed, leisure is not thought of as a priority.
Administrators are often reluctant or unable to allot adequate funds for recreation programs. Correctional
Officers also resist recreation activities because they could interfere with security, which is their primary
job responsibility (Caplan, 1996). Also, there are often scheduling conflicts that cause inmates not to be
released from their housing units in time to participate in recreation programs. Inmates are also frequently
denied the opportunity to attend programs as a punishment mechanism. There is also a predominant
attitude that necessities must first be met before one deserves or earns leisure time (McCall, 1981). The
problem that emerges is that administration does not value leisure time and therefore does not make
concessions that allow inmates to participate in recreation. Formal times for recreation are set and these
times are thought of as “good enough,” even if only 10% of the inmates are able to participate during
those times. If they do allow more time for recreation, they still make a schedule. Most institutions do not
have the manpower or luxury of multiple recreation and leisure leaders to cover the allotted time (McCall,
1981). These views on recreation hinder programs that could help the rehabilitative aspects of recreation.
Possibly the biggest hurdle correctional recreation faces is the public’s viewpoint. Taxpaying
citizens resent the use of their tax money to provide inmates with anything except necessary services.
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 26
This is especially true for services that are considered to turn institutions into “country clubs” (Compton
& Hormachea, 1979). The attitude toward crime and criminals has shifted. They believe that people
should be sent to prison for punishment, not as punishment. They think that incarceration should be
painful and a “tough on criminals” philosophy has emerged (Carlson, 2001). This corresponds with the
“No Frills” movement. Beginning in the mid 1990’s, people began to desire to “get tough on crime” by
limiting or eliminating prison comforts. Several states, due to public pressure, began banning or limiting
certain activities in prisons, such as weightlifting. Other programs that the public wanted cut or restricted
were musical instruments, contact visits with family, telephone access, television, and many recreation
programs (Polson, 2002). Many of the public view recreation as a privilege inmates don’t deserve. Other
members of the public think that other forms of recreation, such as basketball, jogging, or calisthenics
cost less and make more sense (Caplan, 1996). This could be because of the expense associated with
correctional recreation combined with the apparent luxury it provides. “Most hard-working, law-abiding
Americans tend to look at correctional recreation facilities and think, ‘I work hard and obey the laws, but
I’m barely making it financially. If I don’t have tennis courts and softball fields in my backyard, why
should inmates have them?’” (Dallao, 1996, p. 80). This is also a concern of prison administrators. The
public has an uncertain view of correctional recreation, and administration is concerned with spending
limited budget money on experiences that the public might not even have access to (Carter & Russell,
2005). Many members of the public see that taxpayers’ money is providing prisoners with cutting-edge
health clubs that are larger and superior to those found in many universities (Caplan, 1996). Generally,
the public’s attitude towards inmates is that of a retributive justice and punishment system and that
Prisons should be places of work and organized education, not resort hotels, counselling
centers, or social laboratories. It ensures that time spent in prison is not good time but
rather devoted to hard work and education. This is a far more constructive approach to
rehabilitation. (Caplan, 1996, p. 46)
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 27
They think that living conditions within prisons should be sufficiently harsh enough to prevent
offenders from wanting to return. This is coupled with the idea that tax dollars should not be spend on
amenities that make life any easier for those people who have broken the law (Williams, Walker, &
Strean, 2005), including recreation.
This leads into yet another problem correctional recreation faces; budget cuts. When budgets for
correctional facilities start getting dropped, recreation programs are not far behind. Construction of
prisons and proper security demand large amounts of money. With these expenses draining budgets and
the public opinion of recreation in correctional facilities, legislators and prison administration are
encouraged to eliminate recreation. This is because construction and security are necessary evils, and
taxpayers and legislators understand these expenses. However, recreation programs and other programs
like them, are often looked at as expendable (Polson, 2002). Prison administrators and legislators are
becoming “obsessive in their determination to bring down the costs of incarceration. Correctional
programs administrators increasingly are asked to cut costs and to justify a program’s existence in terms
of social and economic analyses” (Adams, 1999, p. 316). This obsession leads to targeting recreation
programs for cutbacks. When program administrators are asked to quantify recreation’s worth they have
very little empirical research to support their claims. While they might report that recreation is a
necessity, administration and legislators are reluctant and unlikely to believe them without research and
data to substantiate their assertions.
Most facilities are overcrowded and have little, if any, recreational facilities. On top of this,
inmate sentences are flexible, they can be extended or shortened (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). This
complicates the problem of tight budgets. When prisons are housing more inmates than they can manage
or their maximum capacity has been surpassed, budgets are shot. Prisons calculate their budgets based on
inmate numbers. If a prison can hold a maximum of 1,000 inmates, then this is what the proposed budget
will be based on (Upton & Harp, 2009). If their population rises to 1,500 inmates, they will not have
enough funds to provide their usual services. Monetary resources will be pulled from unnecessary
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 28
programs and reallocated so the prison is able to meet each inmate’s basic necessities, such as food and
clothing.
However, cuts to recreation programs are already being proposed. For example, a few years ago
Illinois introduced a budget that eliminates 124 correctional recreation positions throughout the state
(Polson, 2002). Ultimately, when governments are facing financial hardship and are forced to show
restraint, the public can find little reason for paying taxes so that prisoners can pursue recreation. If
recreation programs are not cut completely, they are understaffed due to budget constraints. In a study
done in 1981, seventy-five and a half percent of the administrators expressed a need for more recreation
personnel. The inmate to recreational staff ratio at some prisons is approximately 1:947. Expecting one
recreation professional to be responsible for an average of over 900 inmates can only lead to more
problems (Caplan, 1996). Recreation programs are easy targets for cost-cutting measures by the
government, through amendment proposals like the Pryce-Stupak Amendment. This legislation aims to
eliminate weight lifting from prisons. When the media allows the public to see the facilities that prisoners
have access to daily, and the public sees them as unnecessary “frills”, they support cut-back policies
(Caplan, 1996).
Currently, the government has proposed twelve ways to reduce staffing levels of correctional
recreation to reduce the budgets. Polson (2002) identifies these twelve suggestions as
1. Reduce the number of hours, days or seasons recreation is offered
2. Allow inmates to recreate in larger groups
3. Eliminate activities and programs requiring higher levels of supervision
4. Limit recreation to an unsupervised open outdoor exercise recreation yard
5. Reduce the number of activities, sports and programs provided
6. Limit recreation access to a fraction of the inmate population
7. Reduce the number of inmates in the facilities
8. Transfer more recreation management responsibilities to other corrections officers
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 29
9. Transfer more recreation management responsibilities to inmate workers
10. Increased use of community volunteers
11. Eliminate recreation at some facilities
12. Eliminate recreation at all facilities (Polson, 2002, p. 19).
Additionally, correctional recreation professionals who are kept “on staff” can be minimized by providing
remaining staff with training and tools, outsourcing the responsibilities of the recreation department, or
making the remaining staff work overtime. Other tactics listed for reducing the budgets are reducing
hours for recreation staff and reducing pay and benefits (Polson, 2002). These suggestions show how far
the government is willing to go when reducing correctional recreation program budgets.
Adding to this list of problems facing correctional recreation are safety issues and concerns.
Many inmates lack social skills and believe that fighting is an acceptable outlet for their anger, even over
something as simple as another inmate breaking a rule in a game. This can result in a large number of
altercations and extensive violence during sporting events and recreational activities. Rough play can also
land inmates in the infirmary (Caplan, 1996). Also, Recreation Directors can have trouble bringing in
volunteer recreation workers due to security measures. Volunteers must be extensively screened to ensure
they are not friends or relatives of inmates (Caplan, 1996). Staff members at prisons are greatly concerned
with security. The greater amount of security required, the greater amount of money involved. Since
institutions are generally short staffed, staff can have problems implementing general security procedures.
If the staff has problems with general security, recreation programs could become an even greater security
burden on staff (Caplan, 1996). Compromised security can also lead to inadequate supervision of inmates
during recreation. If numerous events or programs are ongoing, it could be impossible for staff to
appropriately supervise them. If the inmates are not supervised properly, violent events can escalate
quickly and get out of hand (Caplan, 1996).
However, recently the biggest perceived threat to security has been weightlifting programs in
prisons. One argument for removing weightlifting programs is that they work to create bigger, stronger,
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 30
more aggressive inmates who will be harder to deal with while incarcerated and also on the outside if they
choose to continue to commit crimes post-release. There has even been legislation proposed in the United
States, the Pryce-Stupak Amendment, to eliminate weightlifting programs in prisons. This amendment
came to fruition due to events that occurred at the 1993 Lucasville Prison riot and the 1994 Riker’s Island
Prison riot. During these riots, weightlifting equipment was used as weapons by inmates to seriously
injure prison staff and cause massive property damage. At Lucasville, inmates used free weights to knock
down a concrete wall that was being used to protect prison staff. This resulted in eleven guards being
taken hostage and one of the eleven being killed. Inmates at Riker’s Island used weightlifting equipment
as weapons against correctional officers, with one inmate beating a guard almost to death using a fiftypound weight. Supporters of this amendment claim the equipment should be removed because it should
be “common sense to keep potentially dangerous equipment away from prisoners” (Caplan, 1996, p. 44).
Prisons also run into many legal issues when providing recreation programs. While prisoners do
not have an explicit right to recreation, they have a right to be protected from psychological pain and
psychological torture. The line linking these two is very thin, but courts have ruled that withholding
recreation for extended periods of time causes psychological problems. There are grey areas, however.
For instance, if an inmate is placed in protective custody or segregation, recreation opportunities can be
limited. Sometimes, inmates in these types of housing can be told that any exercise must be done with the
general population. This could put the inmate’s life at risk or negate the reason for them being in separate
housing units. While prison officials have grounds to deny recreation for certain reasons and for certain
time frames, several court cases have been presented pertaining to recreation. One involved inmates being
allowed access to sunscreen before or during outdoor recreation. The inmates in this case claimed that,
because their family histories showed a tendency toward skin cancer, not allowing sunscreen bottles in
recreation areas constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Another involved a morbidly obese inmate
who claimed that his weight prevented him from sitting at the tables for indoor recreation and he was not
able to participate in recreation activities provided by the institution. Because he could not participate, he
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 31
maintained that the prison was not allowing him access to adequate recreation (Lee, 1996). Prisons are
also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act. They cannot discriminate when allowing access to
programs solely based on a disability. Reasonable adjustments must be made or programs must be offered
for people with disabilities. Prison officials could be required, by law, to modify prison programs to suit
disabled inmates, resulting in expensive changes and increased security risks (Adams, 1999). There was
also another case of an inmate suing the prison they were incarcerated in because they disbanded the
boxing program for supposedly racial motives. The court asserted that certain forms of exercise could not
be denied if the underlying cause was discriminatory (Farber, 2008). The extensive legal issues that can
arise have the possibility to deter prisons from wanting to offer recreation programs, as lawsuits are costs
that prison cannot afford with their limited budgets.
The argument against recreation that holds the most weight is that prisoner participation in
recreation is so low that they do not reap the benefits and it is therefore an unnecessary expense. It has
been argued that inmates cannot release adequate amounts of tension because so few inmates are engaged
in regular physical exercise (Gallant, Sherry, & Nicholson, 2015). Aguilar and Asmussen conducted a
survey to assess inmate participation in recreational activities. They surveyed 496 male inmates. The
responses indicated that the activity most frequently participated in was watching sports on television (72
percent of the inmates reported participating in this activity). One-fourth of the inmates reported that they
did not use the recreation facilities at all. Fifty-two percent of the respondents indicated that they stopped
participating in recreation as a result of incarceration (Aguilar & Asmussen, 1989). Frey and Delaney
(1996) found that “visiting other inmates, reading books, and watching television were the most popular
activities in prison. Other than watching television or visiting with fellow inmates, prisoners did not
participate in a significant amount of leisure activity” (p. 83). If inmates are participating in passive
activities, it is not possible for many of the recreational benefits to be recognized. Frey and Delaney
(1996) also noted that only a small number of inmates participated in basketball, handball, or other active
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 32
recreation. If the highest participation numbers are in passive recreation categories, then it could be said
that
the functions of tension management and time management cannot be correctly
associated with the role of recreation in prison. Since a large portion of inmates profess to
spend a great deal of their leisure time talking to other inmates it is possible that these
conversations include considerable discussion of prison conditions. Thus, leisure could
contribute to unrest rather than prevent its occurrence. (Frey & Delaney, 1996, p. 84)
In conjunction with general non-participation, older inmates rarely participate in recreation activities.
Michael R. Bintz (1974) noted that many recreation programs are dominated by the younger population
(45 years old or younger). He spoke with several inmates spread across all age groups and found that
older inmates refuse to participate in programs that are available or open to the entire population.
However, their participation increased greatly when programs were provided specifically for them, where
younger inmates were not allowed to participate (Brintz, 1974). Even though they want to participate, it is
still an issue. Many institutions do not offer programs specifically for the older population. Therefore, this
is a group that does not participate in recreation on a regular basis. Other reasons for non-participation are
“lack of interest, lack of facilities, lack of time, and lack of funds” (Caplan, 1996, p. 52). Romsa and
Hoffman administered a survey to determine participation patterns of male inmates across nineteen prison
recreation activities. When inmates participating in this study were asked about their interest in
participating in new activities, only 38.6 percent reported a desire to participate (Caplan, 1996). Some
inmates report that their reason for not participating is that they do not enjoy the activities presented in
prisons, although they might have enjoyed them on the outside. Tommy Thomas, an inmate, said
I don't enjoy doing sports in this environment. It blows off a lot of steam. There’s not too
many ways you can blow steam off except for sports. I've played on highly structured
teams (outside the prison) and when you screw up or something on the nice guys will
give you compliments or say that’s all right we'll get them the next time. But here it's a
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 33
total screw up, it's all negative reactions. You can't enjoy it. You can't have fun. (Caplan,
1996, p. 93)
Additionally, many inmates have limited abilities that could keep them from participating. When prisons
experience budget cuts and remove programs as a result, some inmates suffer because they have limited
physical or athletic abilities. This would decrease participation because some inmates will only participate
in particular activities due to either their enjoyment levels or competencies (Caplan, 1996).
Scheduling can also cause a decrease in regular attendance or commitment of inmates, which
threatens the effectiveness of the programs. Activities are often scheduled for times after the inmates
receive their medications, which decreases the inmates’ abilities to participate as they are often lethargic
due to side effects of their medications (Gallant, Sherry, & Nicholson, 2015). Also, inmates are often
motivated to participate by extrinsic rewards, such as trophies or refreshments. Because of this, the
intensity of their participation is shallow. When inmates participate mainly for rewards or through
persuasion, they do not reap the benefits that inmates who become involved due to personal interest do
(Caplan, 1996). Non-participation or inmates only participating in certain activities makes it “difficult to
support the arguments that leisure reduces tension, prepares inmates for life on the outside, or performs
rehabilitative services. Leisure and sport appear to have a non-essential role in prison life. Opportunities
are available but few participate” (Frey & Delaney, 1996, p. 86).
When dealing with non-participation issues, one must also look past the gates and into inmates’
post-incarceration lives. Many prisoners will not continue participating in recreation after their release.
While many inmates want to continue involvement in recreation, their financial situation might prevent
them from doing so. They could also have problems joining teams or leagues due to their status as a
convict (Caplan, 1996).
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 34
Many programs are not effective in helping the inmates attain the benefits of recreation.
Williams, Walker, and Strean (2005) reported that many programs do not utilize treatment models that are
consistent with offender rehabilitation research. Other programs that are used, such as “boot camps,” are
implemented without any evidence that they work. When programs are implemented based on the
punishment principle, that punishment deters future crime, they tend to fail (Williams, Walker, & Strean,
2005). The phenomenon of punishment based recreation was also noted by Compton and Hormachea
(1979), who stated that this idea leads to programs that are not creative nor do they provide inmates with
long-lasting, positive changes. Most programs are stereotypical sports programs, such as basketball and
baseball, or games of horseshoes, checkers, or cards. These programs only begin to tap into the potential
that recreation has to influence permanent changes in offender lives. “These programs do not provide an
opportunity for all inmates to satisfy their leisure needs. They are not designed to encourage the inmate to
develop leisure pursuits which he may easily continue when he returns to the community” (Compton &
Hormachea, 1979, p. 7).
There are many reasons recreation programs fail. The main reasons are a lack of professional staff
and adequate facilities, too strong of an emphasis on security, and administration’s general opposition to
change (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). Lack of proper personnel can damage recreation programs, as
underqualified individuals might not know what to change or implement other than these stereotypical
programs. Inadequate facilities also pose a barrier, as approximately 50 percent of institutions in the
United States were built between 1830 and 1900. These institutions had limited recreational provisions.
Many jails are even older, and 83 percent lack recreation or educational accommodations (Caplan, 1996).
Lack of facilities could be due to the climbing prison populations. When there is a constant increase in
inmates, there are not enough recreation facilities. However, neither the inmates nor the staff seem to
want to improve the situation (Caplan, 1996). Inadequate facilities can prove to be a hindrance to
recreation staff when developing programs. Many inmates are interested in programs that cannot be or are
not offered. This could be due to facilities or the fact that inmate needs are not considered when
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 35
recreation programs are developed (Caplan, 1996). These problems are also evident to inmates, who
report that the
facilities were inadequate and poorly administered, the programs lacked specific goals,
the programs helped pass the time but served no rehabilitative purpose, recreational
interests were not being learned during incarceration, there was very little carry-over
value of prison activities because too many of the sports were team oriented, and attitudes
towards recreational activities were mostly formed before one's incarceration and would
rarely be changed by any available rehabilitation programs. (Caplan, 1996, p. 58)
Recreation programs often lack adequate supervision. When dealing with weight training,
inadequate management can lead to injuries or distortions to the body. When there is no guidance or
instruction, inmates do not learn about the activity, and therefore cannot appreciate what it can do for
them (Caplan, 1996). One inmate stated that “we don't have the proper training system. It's not so much
the training facilities that we have, it's the teaching. A lot of the guys, they can go in there and they don’t
know what they’re doing” (Caplan, 1996, p. 103). He felt that many inmates did not know enough about
weightlifting considering the amount of time spent on it.
It has also been postulated that recreation in correctional settings can have negative effects on
inmates. One negative effect is the possibility for increased aggression. Athletes who compete in
competitive sports are likely to show “anti-social and hostile behavior both during and after events”
(Caplan, 1996, p. 35). Contact sports are more likely to instill these behaviors. Participating in sporting
events may increase inmate aggressiveness as a side effect of the competition. Participants that become
angered during events do not seem to discharge this anger through the activity, instead becoming
generally more violent. Losing can also result in higher aggression levels. This view suggests that
recreational sports can contribute to increasing prison disorder rather than decreasing it (Caplan, 1996).
Recreation programs can also increase inmate stress. This is due to poor attitudes of recreation
professionals, limited staff, rehabilitation programs being cut, overcrowding, and old-fashioned recreation
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 36
ideals (Caplan, 1996). Many recreation leaders do not understand the inmates’ perceived freedom of
leisure. Inmates are not free to choose which activities are offered, which leads to their needs not being
satisfied and adding to inmate stress (Card, 1983).
What can be identified as the root cause of all these aforementioned problems is the fact that
results from studies on recreation in incarceration settings are mixed. Some study results identify
recreation as a crucial tool in the rehabilitative process while other studies classify recreation as useless
other than passing the time in prison. It is difficult to capture the effects of recreation because various
institutions offer different programs. There are also multiple variables that must be taken into
consideration when researching recreation (Caplan, 1996). For example, Frey and Delaney (1996) found
that “traditional justifications for recreation programs in prison, such as release of tension and
rehabilitation, are not supported” (pg. 87). Another study found that
the improvement of one’s self-image, physical health, fitness level, and mental health all
may derive from effective prison recreation. Inmates may increase constructive
recreational skills, improve communication and ties with their families, have an outlet for
frustration and aggression, and develop leadership skills. These are all positive attributes
which potentially contribute to a more stable readjustment to society following release
from prison. (Caplan, 1996, p. 62)
Differing opinions and results in studies leads to a discontinuous view on recreation in
corrections. When results are mixed, no one can decide what role recreation plays. This gives way for
reasonable doubt as to the effectiveness of the programs. When the programs are shown as ineffective, the
administration, public, and legislators support budget cuts which reduce recreation programs. When
budgets are cut, safety measures are compromised due to decreased staff and equipment. Budget cuts are
also responsible for providing ineffective programs and decreased inmate participation. When inmates do
not participate or programs are not effective, benefits are not realized and studies conclude that recreation
is unsuccessful.

Suggestions to Improve Correctional Recreation
While correctional recreation faces many problems, there are also many ways for these problems
to be fixed or improved. Williams, Walker, and Strean (2005) suggested six ways that the delivery of
correctional recreation could be successful.
These include:
• leisure and recreation services should be based on principles of rehabilitation
• services should be viewed as a right
• services should be individualized and take into account cultural background
• services should promote choice, freedom, and control, while decreasing dependence
• services should integrate offenders to the community
• and leisure and recreational services should focus on providing programs to reunite
families. (pg. 57)
They also suggested that correctional recreation that is used to support psychotherapy should be provided
based on either a “strength-based” or “solution-focused” approach. These approaches pinpoint and use
personal offender strengths and resources to enable stress management and positively change behavior.
They also emphasized the importance of personalized assessments before assigning correctional
recreation to inmates. This was because prisoners differ on many factors including motivation and
potential barriers. Williams, Walker, and Strean also encouraged prisons to use Life Development
Intervention (LDI). LDI suggests that personal skills one develops to succeed in recreation are
transferable to everyday life situations. These include performing under pressure, communicating with
others, and having self-control. LDI would allow correctional recreation to be strongly connected to
individualized treatments (Williams, Walker, & Strean, 2005).
Compton and Hormachea (1979) also offered suggestions to improve correctional recreation.
They said that administration attitudes must be addressed and changed. Leisure and recreation’s
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 38
significant and essential role must be stressed, especially to those individuals who have management and
monetary duties. By doing this, recreation could possibly be recognized as more than just a means to
satisfy inmate boredom. They should also accept recreation as a vital tool in reintegration of the offender
to the community. They also recommended that institutions offer extensive education programs and
provide occupational counseling. Prisons should also offer individual and group psychotherapy in
conjunction with recreational services (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). Administration must also see the
inmate as a total person. Merely perceiving the inmate as a total person helps him to become a better
citizen, as you are not focused on rehabilitating one aspect of that person, but instead the person as an
entirety (Caplan, 1996).
The view of prison staff must also be changed. Recreation should be seen as an essential part of
everyday prison living instead of a privilege or extra frill. Rehabilitative recreation in prisons should be
structured as tension-relief and tension-reduction outlets. Corrections officials should not see these
activities as detrimental or hazardous to security. Instead, they should be viewed as productive
contributions that provide opportunities for healthy and appropriate release of inmate energy (Caplan,
1996).
Compton and Hormachea (1979) also suggested that well-rounded programs should be offered.
Clearly, it is not possible to offer every possible recreation activity to all inmates, even with the most
extensive and intricate prison. Some activities are simply not plausible (golf or water sports) and others
pose serious threats to security (skeet shooting). However, if recreation professionals think creatively and
carefully assess inmates’ interests, they should still be able to manage a wide range of activities to make
up a well-rounded program.
Both Compton and Hormachea (1979) and Williams, Walker, and Strean (2005) advocated for
the use of leisure assessments when planning recreation activities. Compton and Hormachea cover several
different assessments that could be used. The first is the Constructive Leisure Activity Survey. This is a
questionnaire which is five pages long. It deals with a list of 50 general leisure activities. The respondent
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 39
is asked to check whether they have tried the activity, would like to try it, or no have no interest in it. The
client is also asked about religious affiliations, financial aspects, and skills. The counselor uses this
information in conjunction with other data to create a referral worksheet which lists specific activities and
where they can be carried out. Another is the Leisure Activities Bank (LAB). The LAB is a psychological
assessment tool that identifies seven activity factors. The client identifies their past participation and
expected future involvement in 120 different recreation activities. The Leisure Interest Inventory (LII)
uses five general qualities of activities to determine preferred leisure activities. Items are grouped by
popularity and the client is asked to choose activities from eighty groups of three activities. The client
must choose the activity they like the most and the least out of the three. The Mirenda Leisure Interest
Finder presents the client with a list of interests in different categories. The client then rates the activities
on a scale of one to five, which are plotted on a graph. The Pie of Life attempts to aid the client in
visualizing their use of free time. A circle, divided into 24 pieces that each represent an hour, is presented
and the client is asked to fill in each hour with how it is used. They then complete some statements about
leisure preferences (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). Any of these assessments would be appropriate to
establish personalized leisure needs for the inmates.
Compton and Hormachea (1979) also outlined the process for developing a program. They
identified six steps. Step one is determining program framework. In order to do this a survey must be
conducted. The survey should cover leisure interests, an inventory of the current facilities and equipment,
and inventory of staff and their skills, community resources, and rules and regulations of the facility. In
step two, the philosophy and approach of the program should be developed. This should be in line with
the rules and regulations of the facility and also be based on the fact that recreation is important. It should
also account for the results the program intends to achieve. Step three involves planning the program
offerings. Both active and passive activities should be considered and the time periods offered should
vary. Implementing the program occurs in step four. Recreation staff should make sure the inmates are
informed about the different types of programs and record inmates’ participation patterns. Step five
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 40
involves evaluating the program and the inmates. Staff should use information gathered in step four to
assist in determining the effectiveness of the offerings and the inmates’ attitudes toward them. Finally,
step six involves making corrections and adjustments. Recreation professions should determine what went
wrong and fix it. These might include changes to specific activities or the direction of the program as a
whole. Through these six steps, recreation departments in correctional facilities should be able to develop
effective recreation programs that maximize inmate involvement.
Sandra Little (1995) noted five practices that should be implemented by recreation professionals
working in correctional settings. First, she noted the need to increase the diversity of recreation program
offerings. Active and passive group, individual, physical, and intellectual activities should be
incorporated. A major reason given for needing to expand the programs is the fact that many prisoners
stop participating in recreation once they are incarcerated. Second, she noticed the need to increase
opportunities for recreation presented to females and older inmates. Many times, these groups are
overlooked when creating recreation programs. She also suggests shifting recreation’s focus from
diversionary activities to rehabilitative and educational activities. Recreation can be incorporated with
other intervention programs. An example given was blending parenting programs with recreation
opportunities that allow for bonding between children and parents. Another proposal was including
recreation in comprehensive programs. Programs such as camping programs allow for a multifaceted
approach, in which inmates are included in the planning and implementation stages. Finally, recreation
should allow for adventure-based activities for both youth and adult offenders. These programs allow for
building new peer groups and family cooperation (Little, 1995).
In addition to these suggestions, Arnie Caplan (1996) noted that “the recreation programs in a
prison should be deliberately planned, and not represent merely a way to spend unoccupied time” (1996,
p. 32). Recreation in prison should be planned in such a way that it purposefully benefits the inmates
more than providing a relief for boredom. He also suggested that recreation professionals should look for
incentives to prevent hostile and aggressive feelings instead of implementing physically competitive
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 41
opportunities that attempt to release aggression and tension. Instead, inmates should be taught to control
their aggression to help manage aggressive tendencies long-term (Caplan, 1996). Another proposition for
improving correctional recreation is to use different methods to ease inmate stress. Recreational
assessments need to be performed to determine the connection between perceived recreational freedom
and lowered stress. Additionally, recreation should be founded on more extensive and reliable analyses so
that high-quality programs are ensured (Caplan, 1996). Recreation professionals should also assist
prisoners in becoming knowledgeable in a range of activities. Increasing an inmates’ control over their
activities helps to develop more profound involvement in their activities. This corresponds with easing
inmate stress by changing the inmates’ outlook on recreation and transforming recreation from a negative
influence into a positive influence (Caplan, 1996).
Larry Williams (1981) also developed his own list of recommendations for improving
correctional recreation in prisons. He examined thirty-three state correctional institutions and documented
present recreational services offered. Four elements were studied. These were recreation personnel,
facilities, programming, and funding. Through this study, he identified several ways that correctional
recreation could be improved. He believed that
• in-service training and staff development should be conducted by individual states or
professional associations within the prions lacking organized recreation services or
for those desirous of improving their programs. Employing educational specialists
would enhance existing programs.
• Organized prison recreation services should be designed to serve all ages but special
attention should be directed toward the 16- to 35-year-old age group since this group
make up over fifty percent of the population of the prisons surveyed
• Operating budgets for recreation services should be expanded to provide sufficient
funds to conduct adequate programs, especially in smaller prisons
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 42
• Use of community indoor and outdoor facilities should be encouraged to offer
additional outlets for prison recreation activities
• Institutional recreation programming efforts need to be expanded to incorporate all
programming categories into the organized recreation program. Special attention
should be devoted to hobby groups, literary activities, and outdoor recreation to
balance leisure service delivery modes.
• More institutions should consider the resources/talents within the inmate population
in their overall leisure time program planning efforts
• Statewide coordination of recreation services within states would provide more
resources for prison recreation services
• Institutions of higher learning should develop quality programs of study in
correctional recreation (Williams L. R., 1981, p. 58)
Williams admitted that these recommended changes would not drastically alter the criminal justice system
instantly. However, he saw them as a starting point. He was focused on making life in institutions more
humane, going on to state that “as dedicated... professionals, we should be capable of leaping over the
prison walls and unlocking the cell doors... to improve the quality of recreation services for incarcerated
offenders” (Williams L. R., 1981, p. 58).
Recently, in an endeavor to enhance correctional services, community corrections have had more
importance placed on them. Some correctional institutions, such as jails, have been closed to make room
for more community correctional centers to open. These centers allow for social ties between the
offender, the community, and the family to be rebuilt. Using community resources offers offenders the
chance to experience recreation similar to what they will encounter post-incarceration (Caplan, 1996).
The process of using community-based corrections involves utilizing appropriate community resources to
their fullest degree. The goal is to “re-educate, rehabilitate, and redirect the attitudes and behavior of
offenders, enabling them to become self-sufficient and productive members of society” (Compton &
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 43
Hormachea, 1979, p. 54). These types of institutions offer offenders a wide range of programs along with
recreation and leisure counseling, which play important roles in helping individuals reform their lives
(Compton & Hormachea, 1979). Community-based correctional facilities allow for children and families
of the offender to benefit from the inmates’ recreational interests. Also, giving the offender the chance to
participate in activities with their partner and children gives them a greater chance of keeping their family
together (Caplan, 1996). Community-based corrections also helps avoid “social shock,” which is the,
often difficult, adjustment period resulting from long-term incarceration. Community-based correction
centers consist of community correctional centers, pre-release centers, half-way houses, and regional
facilities. While it can be costly to provide this type of network, it would cost about the same as the
current containment method which has resulted in a revolving door for offenders (Compton &
Hormachea, 1979). In fact, Brayshaw (1981) stated that
The move toward community corrections is not really a choice. The cost of the
alternative – building bigger prisons – is even more unpalatable than the struggle to learn,
after the fact, how to operate successful programs in the community. (p. 53)
When speaking directly about weight training programs, education could greatly improve this
experience. Institutions could designate classrooms in which videos could be shown or mechanics could
be taught (Caplan, 1996). However, this does not have to be limited to weight lifting. It was postulated
that many of the inmates would be highly receptive to professional or educated athletes entering the
prison and holding clinics that teach the basic or elementary skills of several sports (Caplan, 1996). A
correctional officer, Wayne Woods, thinks this would be beneficial. He said that he would like to “see
qualified people come into the institution on a contract basis to do seminars in Physical Education”
(Caplan, 1996, p. 104). He thought that more clinics and seminars would enhance interest among inmates.
This would also help to fix the problem of most recreation, weight lifting included, being unstructured
and unsupervised (Caplan, 1996).
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 44
Many researchers have encouraged prisons to invest in multi-purpose facilities, complete with a
gymnasium and locker room. Ideally, the gym could also be used as an auditorium for theater productions
or movies. It has been suggested that only equipment in safe condition be used and thorough, periodic
inspections take place for safety and security (Caplan, 1996). While this seems expensive, building a
multi-purpose facility would eliminate the need for prisons to constantly convert existing facilities to fit
the needs of recreation staff and inmates. It would also allow recreation professionals to offer a wider
variety of activities for offenders.
Why Should Recreation Be Present in Correctional Facilities?
Recreation allows inmates to be productively occupied. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a historian, wrote
that “the most dangerous threat hanging over American society is the threat of leisure… and those that
have the least preparation for it will have most of it” (Compton & Hormachea, 1979, p. 27). Prisoners are
often presented with numerous leisure opportunities and are ill-prepared to handle them. Inmates in
correctional institutions frequently suffer from a lack of leisure education and think that leisure time is
time to be squandered or invested in criminal activities (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). This leads to a
cycle where leisure and recreation time is dedicated to generally unacceptable behavior. This cycle lands
individuals in the criminal justice system, which removes any meaningful leisure activities while
simultaneously presenting them with more leisure opportunities (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). While in
prison, unoccupied minds lead to prisoners thinking about inappropriate ways to fill their leisure time
(Caplan, 1996). Recreation keeps inmates productively occupied while incarcerated and can help teach
inmates how to use their free time post-incarcerated. “Recreation will continue to serve as a bridge
between hard time and free time for those offenders who wish to use it” (Caplan, 1996, p. 51).
Recreation also increases institutional safety. Inmates can release negative or pent-up feelings of
anger and aggression. During sporting events or recreational activities inmates become “normal humans
with normal interests” (Caplan, 1996, p. 25). They are allowed to relieve their stress and clear their minds
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 45
just like a normal human would on the outside, which keeps them from getting angrier and causing
problems (Caplan, 1996). One inmate, Peter Percy was quoted saying,
take for example you're having a bad day. Basically, myself, I can't speak for others, but
myself, if I'm having a rough day, instead of taking it out on you or this guy or this guy, I
take it out on the weights (Caplan, 1996, p. 94).
Other inmates back this view. Another inmate said that amenities such as weight rooms and gymnasiums
keep institutions from becoming more violent because those are places “where people go and express
themselves physically, emotionally, and verbally” (Caplan, 1996, p. 94). The study conducted by Frey
and Delaney confirmed this view stating that “leisure participation … provides participants with
constructive outlets for pent-up feelings of frustration, hostility and aggression” (Frey & Delaney, 1996,
p. 82). A previously discussed study conducted by Roy Hunter suggested that budget cuts targeted at
recreation led to increased crime in correctional institutions (Hunter, 1986). Therefore, it appears accepted
that participation in recreation programs provide inmates with opportunities to “blow off steam and
escape the monotony of the prison routine” (Gallant, Sherry, & Nicholson, 2015, p. 4). This benefit is also
noted by prison administration, as they reported that inmate participation directly correlated to a decline
in violent occurrences in prisons. Not only are sports used for diversion by prison staff, but also by the
inmates themselves. Gallant, Sherry, and Nicholson remarked that
On one hand, sport and exercise provide prisoners with vehicles for self-expression and
physical freedom. On the other hand, prison officials know that involvement in sports and
exercise activities help make inmates more tractable and compliant. Therefore, the
cultivation of the body through sports and fitness activities is simultaneously a source of
personal liberation and social control. (2015, p. 4)
Allowing inmates to release tension and aggression also allows the guards to maintain social
control. Through recreation, tension levels can be kept at reasonable and controllable levels. Prison
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 46
officials can develop an understanding of the prison climate through monitoring how groups form during
recreation and leisure time (Frey & Delaney, 1996). Many inmates even observed that recreation is a
necessity in keeping the prison calm and under control. Prisoners claimed to participate in recreation to
“relieve stress/frustration, alleviate boredom, develop and maintain self-esteem, and create friendships
through common interests” (Caplan, 1996, p. 117). These factors play key roles in controlling the
atmosphere within a prison (Caplan, 1996). Privileges such as weightlifting and recreation keep inmates
engaged and reduces the time they have to cause trouble. Reducing or eliminating recreation would give
them more opportunities in which to involve themselves in activities such as escape attempts, drug
schemes, and assaults on correctional officers or other inmates (Polson, 2002). If prisoners are allowed to
release their frustrations, and the guards use recreation to keep social control, then recreation can be used
to increase institutional safety.
Another reason recreation departments should be present in correctional institutions is that they
are cost effective and cheap to operate. Recreation programs represent very small percentages of total
correctional operating budgets. For example, the Colorado Department of Corrections’ operating budget
in 2001 requested a total of $548,448,611. Only $5,865,341 was allotted for recreation. This amounts to
only 1.1 percent of the total amount requested (Polson, 2002). That $5,865,341 might seem like a lot of
money for recreation programs. However, that amount must be spread over the entire Department of
Corrections, which covers 20 adult prisons along with juvenile facilities (State of Colorado, 2017). If we
only account for the 20 adult prisons, that allots $293,267.05 per prison. This must cover recreation staff
salaries, facility upkeep, and equipment costs. The average salary for a correctional recreation officer in
Colorado is $43,190 (the beginning salary is $32,740 and the cap is $61,960) (State of Colorado, 2017). If
the institution employs 4 correctional recreation leaders (Kentucky averages 4 recreation officers per
institution. The State of Colorado’s webpage did not give a number on how many officers are employed,
so it was estimated that the average was equivalent to that of Kentucky.), that means that approximately
$172,760 of the allotted $293,267.05 is spent on salaries, leaving $120,507.05 for anything the recreation
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 47
department needs throughout the year. However, the actual amount is much lower. These calculations did
not account for money sent to juvenile facilities. There are currently eleven juvenile detention centers
operating in Colorado (State of Colorado, 2017). This means that the per institution recreation allotment
drops to approximately $189,204.55 on average. Once the salaries of the assumed four recreation leaders
are accounted for, this amount drops again to $16,444.55. This means that, on average, each institution
has just over $16,000 per year to spend on recreation. When this amount is compared to the requested
budget of $5,865,341 it seems trivial. This is also shown through Kentucky’s expenditures. Since all 13
state prisons in the Commonwealth of Kentucky have a gym, they all have recreation departments. These
departments employ a total of 55 full-time recreation personnel. The cost associated with the recreation
departments is $2.4 million annually. If we assume that this is spread evenly over the 13 institutions, that
means that each facility’s recreation department is allocated $184,615.38. With the total budget for the
Department of Corrections reaching upwards of $451 million, or approximately $35 million per
institution, the recreation department’s expenses account for one half of a percent (0.05%) (Upton &
Harp, 2009). As evidenced, these programs do not require a lot of capital to operate in relation to overall
corrections budgets.
When discussing the cost of these programs, one must also consider the healthcare costs that are
not necessary due to recreation. The benefits of physical activity on one’s health are clearly established.
Exercise increases an individual’s cardiovascular health and decreases the risk of colon cancer,
noninsulin-dependent diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and obesity. The risks worsen for elderly
inmates who are not physically active. Since the prison system must shoulder the weight of paying for
inmate health care during imprisonment, these factors must be considered when making decisions
concerning recreation (Amtmann, 2001). The State of California Resources Agency substantiates these
claims. They maintain that the physical health benefits of recreation include reducing obesity, diminishing
the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease, boosting the immune system, and increasing
life expectancy (California State Parks, 2005). Research suggests that “exercise programs for elderly
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 48
inmates may have a positive effect on the number of infirmary visits, which may have a long-term effect
on inmate health” (Amtmann, 2001, p. 6). Additionally, chronic lifestyle-related diseases can be
developed through a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity can help protect from developing these diseases
which lowers healthcare costs (Amtmann, 2001). If inmates become healthier through physical activity,
they are less likely to make frequent visits to the infirmary. With medical expenses accounting for over
$51 million, less trips to the infirmary would save money. The top five medical treatments for inmates are
diseases of the circulatory system, tumors and other growths, injury or poisoning, diseases of the
digestive system, and diseases of the respiratory system (Upton & Harp, 2009). Physical activity can play
a major role of preventing these diseases and reducing institutional medical costs.
Recreation can also allow inmates to learn valuable skills they will need post-incarceration.
According to Garrett Heyns, a Michigan warden, recreation brings inmates into contact with opportunities
that will lead to them seeking out new recreation pursuits once they return to their communities. He
believes that recreation awards inmates the chance to learn to fill their leisure time with non-criminal
activities, which is beneficial to both the inmate and society (Compton & Hormachea, 1979). Other new
skills that can be learned through recreation can lead to possible job opportunities. Inmates at the Lincoln
Correctional Center in Illinois are afforded the opportunity to train to become coaches, officials, timers,
and event organizers (Caplan, 1996). Training in these areas can lead to careers the inmate can pursue
after their release. More basic skills that are taught through recreation are teamwork, fair play, creating
friendships, conflict resolution, and accepting authority (Caplan, 1996). These skills can transfer to
everyday life and can help the offender in almost any work environment. Many offenders struggle with
these concepts and deficiencies in these areas could have contributed to their incarceration in the first
place. While teaching these elementary ideas might seem like a waste of time or unnecessary, it is
important to develop these concepts for the inmate to be a functioning member of society. Once an inmate
masters these ideas and is proficient in their recreational interests, they might find an opportunity to build
their interest into something more. It has been observed that an inmate’s recreational interests can be a
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 49
stable base to build career goals on. They can even be more stable than basing career opportunities on
occupational histories. Recreation provides offenders with opportunities to realize where their talents lie
and turn these talents into occupations (Caplan, 1996). Teaching these skills and creating career
opportunities can lower the change of an offender returning to the system by giving them tools they need
to live a normal, crime-free life.
Conclusion
Ever since prisons started offering inmates structured recreation, problems have arisen. These
problems range from views on recreation, to budget and safety issues, and to ineffective programs.
Ultimately, these problems hold a lot of weight, especially with the general public and legislators. It is
hard for one to ignore many of the issues. The public’s main concern is the tax money that is poured into
correctional recreation departments. They do not want to see their money squandered on frivolous
programs that might not work. Prison administrators are concerned with safety, since it is a large part of
their job. They cannot look past the fact that many recreation tools could be used as weapons if an inmate
wished to do so. Even the inmates themselves have trouble seeing recreation as anything more than a way
to relieve boredom and monotony. However, although correctional recreation is presented with numerous
problems, it still has immense value. While the problems cannot be ignored, neither can the benefits.
Recreation provides various health benefits, keep inmates occupied, and teaches necessary skills.
Administration should work with the government and the public to attempt to fix or eliminate the
problems correctional recreation faces. While some problems will always arise, such as safety concerns or
low participation, many others could be eradicated. Prison staff and administration along with public
views on recreation in prisons can be changed through education and additional research. Correcting these
views and allowing the public to understand the role recreation plays in correctional institutions would
also likely fix the budget issues. If recreation was seen in a positive light and as a necessity, the public
and legislators would be less willing to drastically cut funding to these programs. Safety risks can be
Running Head: CORRECTIONAL RECREATION: AN OVERVIEW Page | 50
minimized through supervision of activities and educating offenders about recreation’s worth. If they
understand how beneficial recreation can be and that increasing safety concerns could eliminate
recreation all-together, they would be more likely to comply and appreciate the equipment. While these
risks cannot be outright abolished, they can be diminished. Fixing ineffective programs goes along with
increasing participation. If institutions created adequate programs that interested a wide variety of
inmates, they would be more likely to participate. Staff could also motivate inmates to participate through
education endeavors. If inmates know how to exercise and the physical benefits of recreation they might
be more willing to participate. Institutions could also use Life Development Intervention (LDI) techniques
that connect recreation to individualized treatment. This would allow inmates the chance to realize how
much positive recreation can impact their lives.
It is promising that attitudes towards correctional recreation are already beginning to change.
Arnie Caplan (1996) noted that recreation staff and Correctional Officers agree with the “official”
ideology of prison sports. This philosophy, as put forth by the NCRA, states that
recreational sports programs involve far more than merely serving as a way for inmates to
escape from the reality of prison life. It is also an opportunity for them to make changes
in their criminal attitudes and behaviors. Recreational sports programs in prisons help
reduce stress, overcome social weaknesses, and promote physical well-being. Besides
giving inmates an opportunity to relieve the pressures of prison life, they promote healthy
physical, mental, and social abilities. A good recreational sports program should include
an area which focuses on the overall fitness of the individual. Inmates would then
presumably take more pride in themselves and in their well-being if physical fitness is
presented as an important issue. Recreational sports would also help to instill pro-social
values, leaving inmates with a sense of purpose and well-being. Other assumed benefits
of such programs are education and the promotion of good sportsmanship in a safe,
secure, and humane environment. (Caplan, 1996, pp. 111-112)

Some prison administrators also believe that recreation experiences have “considerable value in helping
inmates to adjust to the responsibilities and obligations that they will face upon their return to society”
(Caplan, 1996, p. 56). In a study organized by Marcia Carter and Kelly Russell (2005), they surveyed
administrators and staff at correctional institutions to determine their attitudes towards correctional
recreation. Respondents were asked to complete a survey consisting of open- and closed-ended questions.
Closed-ended questions required them to select from a list of alternatives while open-ended questions
required respondents to identify types of recreation that should be offered, the safety issues they
connected with recreation, the relationship to their role with recreation, the needed amount of financial
support for recreation programs, and their opinion on the effects of participation in recreation on
recidivism. From their findings, it was concluded that the staff believed that
Inmate participation in recreation allows the inmates to burn energy, relieve stress, help
pass the time, increase their self-esteem, exercise and get fresh air. They also believed
that when inmates have something to look forward to, such as recreation, they are
temporarily able to “escape” from other issues they might be facing in their lives. (Carter
& Russell, 2005, p. 83)
Additionally, they found that administration and staff felt that recreation provides important programs for
offenders. They observed that “recreation is viewed as a useful tool for stress relief, increasing selfesteem, breaking up the monotony of jail life, and promoting physical health and wellness” (Carter &
Russell, 2005, p. 83). Changing attitudes on correctional recreation is a step in the right direction. If
enough minds are changed, maybe correctional recreation can be utilized to its fullest extent.
Through all the research and evidence, one can conclude that although correctional recreation
faces many problems, the benefits outweigh the costs. Facilities should strive to improve their existing
programs while simultaneously developing new recreation programs. Prisons and incarceration facilities
should continue the use of recreation because it keeps inmates occupied, increases institutional safety, is

cost effective, limits inmate trips to the infirmary, and teaches prisoners vital skills needed for reentering
society.

ConsumerSignals is a longitudinal exploration of consumer spending behavior and the drivers behind it. Every month, we survey thousands of consumers across more than a
dozen countries about their sense of financial well-being, spending intentions, and upcoming purchases big and small—from their next trip to the grocery store to
upcoming vacations, next vehicle purchase, and more.
 
 
Now in its fourth year, ConsumerSignals provides a view into consumers’ everyday finances and the spending strategies being used to navigate an unpredictable world. We
invite you to explore our interactive data dashboard, collection of proprietary consumer indices, and deep-dive articles.

 Financial well-being 
 
Deloitte's financial well-being index (FWBI) captures changes in how consumers are feeling about their present-day financial health and future financial security.
Unlike consumer confidence indices, which often focus on consumer opinion about economic conditions (e.g., health of the economy or labor market), the financial
well-being index focuses on the consumer’s own financial experience, where they’re the experts.

 How we measure financial well-being 
 
 Financial well-being is measured across six dimensions of financial health (details in the info button above). 
 Higher index values indicate stronger financial well-being. 
 The global index line represents an average of eight of the top 10 global economies by 2022 GDP according to World Bank.

 Methodology Note 
 
Spending intentions are represented using a three-month exponential moving average (EMA). An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average that
places more weight on recent data points, making it more responsive to recent price changes compared to a simple moving average (SMA). EMA is commonly used to
smooth out data and help visualize long-term trends.
 
 Non-discretionary categories were recategorized to include housing, transportation, groceries, and health care.

 What is the FFI? 
 Everyone needs to eat, but food is becoming less affordable for some. 
 
The FFI is a monthly proprietary measure of behaviors associated with financial stress at the grocery store—and how they may be shaping the way consumers shop
for food.
 
 Higher index values indicate consumers cite being more frugal.

Facilities maintenance is essential to keeping companies in business . Imagine how many customers your restaurant would lose if uncleaned grease traps contaminated the food, leaving people sick after eating. Now, the remaining customers’ meals are delayed while you fix the issue. Why let one mistake jeopardize your operation when you can prevent it? 
 In recent years, technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices have provided facility maintenance companies with revolutionary tools to improve business operations. The shift toward green and sustainable solutions is helping companies become safer and more cost-effective. If you’re still re acting to problems after they occur, you’re likely wasting time and resources on constant repairs or losing customers due to inconsistent service quality. These five facility maintenance trends can improve the way you run your business, just as they have for others. 
 Facilities Maintenance: A Frontier of Innovation in Effective Building Management 
 Facilities management strategies have historically followed the mantra: “If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.” Unfortunately, when something does break, the downtime for repairs is costly — resulting in $400 billion in annual losses every year for the top 2,000 companies globally. Thankfully, recent innovations in facilities maintenance have prompted multiple industries to rethink their reactionary approach to equipment failures and adopt a more proactive strategy. Today, forward-thinking companies can manage their facilities and maintenance through a network of advanced technologies, offering unprecedented control over equipment performance and ushering in an era of headache-free facility maintenance. 
 This new era of facility maintenance goes beyond simply letting technology do all the work for you. The best facility maintenance companies combine well-trained technicians, data-driven insights, and environmentally friendly practices to solve the biggest maintenance problems that keep businesses from optimizing their potential. 
 1. Emphasis on Preventative and Predictive Maintenance 
 In facilities maintenance, both preventative and predictive maintenance are game changers. Preventative maintenance involves routine facility checks based on expected equipment life cycles. Predictive maintenance is more proactive, leveraging real-time equipment performance data captured and analyzed by IoT sensors to identify deviations from normal patterns predicting potential failures. Think of preventative maintenance, like visiting the doctor for your annual check-up, while predictive maintenance is like going because your Apple Watch detected an unusual rise in your resting heart rate over six consecutive days. 
 Both are part of a shift towards proactive maintenance strategies, offering more peace of mind compared to waiting for something to break. Reactive maintenance may seem cost-effective in the short term — fewer inspections and less planned downtime — but it leads to higher long-term costs, including unplanned disruptions, shorter equipment lifespans, and higher repair costs. That’s why reactive maintenance costs businesses 12-18% more than preventive maintenance and why the global predictive maintenance market is projected to grow from $8-$10 billion in 2023 to over $100 billion by the end of 2033. 
 2. Integration of Smart Technologies and IoT 
 Manpower in facilities maintenance is most effective when optimized by smart technologies. The efficiency is remarkable when smart HVAC systems automatically adjust air conditioning performance based on the facility’s minute-by-minute needs, automated lighting controls conserve energy by turning off lights in unoccupied areas, and sensors give remote, real-time insights into the health of equipment. This optimization can save facilities managers 20% in maintenance costs while offering invaluable transparency into how their facilities are running now — and how they’ll run in the future. 
 These devices can wirelessly share data across a connected network, enabling a system where maintenance requests are automatically generated when they’re needed. If a smart thermostat senses a room is unoccupied, it can wirelessly communicate this information to a smart HVAC system, which will then adjust to conserve energy. Smart devices and IoT are becoming the subconscious of a facility, self-regulating in the background so businesses can tackle the issues in front of them. 
 3. Focus on Sustainability and Green Maintenance Practices 
 Running a profitable business at the expense of the environment is quickly becoming outdated as laws and regulations aim to curb pollution, reduce carbon emissions, and conserve natural resources. Major global companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are taking corporate social responsibility seriously, adopting green maintenance practices after publicly committing to being carbon-free by 2030 . They’ve also contributed to the more than 100,000 projects certified by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the gold standard in green building rating systems. 
 Simple upgrades, such as WaterSense-labeled faucets, can reduce water flow by at least 30%. For a commercial facility, this can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in water bill savings, which can be reinvested into making businesses more efficient. Eco-friendly cleaning products made from biodegradable ingredients, low-volatile organic compound (VOC) paints that reduce indoor pollution, and energy-efficient HVAC systems are a handful of the many ways to maintain your facility cost-effectively and sustainably. In today’s world, the future of your facility should be green. 
 4. Enhanced Use of Data and Analytics 
 Data and analytics are seismically shifting modern facilities maintenance by informing smarter decisions with invaluable foresight. Smart facility maintenance companies are using data and analytics in conjunction with enterprise asset management software like Upkeep, which helps with maintenance planning by monitoring equipment performance and automating work orders to available technicians before issues become critical. Business intelligence tools like Tableau aggregate data from a company’s chosen management systems to help facility managers locate areas in the operation that can be altered to reduce cost. 
 If leveraged strategically, data and analytics can prevent costly equipment repair. Imagine traveling 1,000 miles without GPS giving you the fastest route or telling you when to anticipate traffic ahead. Sure, you’d probably reach your goal, but it’d take a lot longer, and you’d waste a lot more gas. Data and analytics are like turning your Ford Explorer into the KIIT from Knight Rider , helping you confidently move into the future of facilities maintenance. 
 5. Workforce Training and Upskilling 
 With these technological advancements becoming standard in facilities maintenance, you need technicians up-to-date on how to operate and maintain advanced equipment like smart HVAC systems. They also need to adhere to sustainability regulations and goals, and be adept at the latest predictive maintenance practices. If the technician you hire is only trained in the past, you’ll end up spending valuable time and money fixing issues in the future in the form of subpar job performance, potential customer dissatisfaction caused by preventable delays, and a higher risk of equipment failure. 
 Constant audits of workforce performance and industry knowledge are essential for maintenance service providers to stay ahead of a constantly evolving technology revolution. One of the wisest investments a service provider can make is in future-proof training programs -LEED certification, IoT device installation and monitoring, and workplace safety protocols. Technology isn’t slowing down, so it’s imperative companies move at the speed of now. 
 Brandpoint Services: Your Ally for Trendsetting Facilities Maintenance 
 As companies expand and customer demands increase, facilities maintenance has evolved to keep up with the changing world. Facility maintenance companies are following these five trends to keep their operations running smoothly and their customers happy: 
 
 Proactive maintenance over reactive maintenance: Using data-driven insights to extend equipment life cycles and reduce maintenance downtime by addressing asset changes before they become problems instead of after. 
 IoT and Smart Device Integration: Smart sensors are used for real-time data insights into equipment, and facilities need to predict when to schedule maintenance. 
 Sustainability and Green Maintenance Practices: Switching to eco-friendly products and prioritizing green building certifications to reduce negative environmental impact and save money while conserving natural resources. 
 Increased Data and Analytics Use: Streamlining facility operations with more certainty by making data-driven decision-making central to maintenance strategies. 
 Workforce Training and Upskilling : Ensuring a consistent quality of maintenance by working with technicians trained in the latest technology, shaping the facilities maintenance landscape. 
 
 These are more than trends; they’re keys to unlocking the true potential of your facility maintenance operation.

The facilities management industry is witnessing a pronounced shift towards sustainable and technology-driven practices, with a growing emphasis on smart buildings, energy efficiency, and environmental stewardship. Integration of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and data analytics are becoming integral to optimise facility operations and enhance occupant experiences. However, these advancements bring forth a set of challenges, including cybersecurity risks, the need for upskilling the workforce, and ensuring seamless interoperability of diverse systems. As organisations strive to align FM strategies with broader business goals, the sector is at the forefront of adapting to the changing global landscape, driving innovation, and ensuring resilient and future-ready facilities. One thing is certain: w herever you look, it seems like “data” is the key. Smart management of the supply chain Supply management is becoming more and more important by the day. Maintenance just got more expensive, especially if you also factor in the labour shortage and inflation. Team up with suppliers, see them as partners and unlock all the collaborative potential in the new age of business-to-business relationships. Supply management and supply chains are not a sum-zero game anymore – both parties will win or lose at the same time if they don’t focus on collaboration , innovation and transparency. Beyond simple procurement, today’s FM teams build strategic alliances with suppliers, viewing them as collaborative partners who can help innovate and sustain operations. By aligning with suppliers to ensure transparent pricing, quality control, and resource availability, facilities can mitigate inflationary pressures and avoid disruptions. Flexibility, diversity and inclusion These aren’t just buzzwords anymore. Remember when everyone and their mum used to say the consumers of the future would demand businesses and facilities to be more diverse and inclusive? Well, flash news: those consumers of the future have grown and are a major part of the market right now. Facilities managers will have to be aware of elements such as inclusive language in their spaces, welcoming diversity of beliefs and sexual orientation and even going as further as designing and managing gender-neutral bathrooms. Companies that prioritise inclusivity improve user satisfaction and compliance whilst fostering a reputation for diversity. This responsiveness to changing social expectations is proving to be a competitive advantage, building trust among employees and visitors alike. Hybrid work and space usage It’s fair to say we’re no longer the same after the COVID-19 pandemic. Workdays will probably never go back to what they were , and all signs point towards hybrid work. Workers will keep coming to the office a few times a week and work remotely for the remainder of the time. Since people stopped coming to work every day, companies require less office space and may adopt a “hot-desk” policy. In fact, workers are not the only ones who may benefit from these changes. A recent report by Deloitte points out that reducing real estate footprints has several benefits, including cutting travel costs, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. However, optimising these limited workspaces is a challenge for facilities managers. There’s only one way around it: monitoring how space is used. This brings us to a new trend: location awareness and sensor technology. Sensors, which should be unnoticeable, can be used to monitor occupancy, room temperature and humidity, etc. That data allows facility managers to adjust to real space usage, optimise space and provide comfort at all times. Digital workplace services Data from sensors can be collected directly onto the building management system or facility management software . But that’s not the only digital trend facility managers will need to contend with. User experience is the greatest trend of the last decade, and human-centric FM and Maintenance will grow even more with Industry 5.0. The question is, how can you provide a great experience in hybrid workplaces? First, we recommend integrating facility management software with other tools or apps the company uses regularly. For example, integrate your FM software with apps to book conference or meeting rooms, use communication tools to receive feedback, and so on. You should also streamline service requests (e.g. reports about printers, broken coffee machines and other communal equipment). Sustainability, building efficiency, and circular economy practices Another hot topic for 2025 is sustainability. This has become a core component of FM, extending beyond simple cost-cutting to encompass circular economy principles that minimise waste and promote resource efficiency. By reusing materials and reducing energy consumption, facility managers help reduce environmental impact and support long-term sustainability goals. Embracing renewable energy sources, optimising water use, and investing in energy-efficient infrastructure all play crucial roles. These practices also align FM strategies with organisational goals for corporate social responsibility, attracting sustainability-conscious stakeholders and tenants. In addition to the circular economy, building efficiency is another pillar of FM’s sustainability efforts. Smart sensors, as mentioned, help track energy usage patterns, allowing facility managers to identify and address inefficiencies. Simple solutions like motion-sensing lights and automated HVAC systems significantly reduce energy costs. Once optimisation reaches its limits, benchmarking energy use can justify retrofitting or installing better insulation. These steps ensure facilities are not only environmentally friendly, but also financially sustainable in the long term. Sustainable Development Goals and Facility Management 7 initiatives for a more accountable sector Proactive maintenance The benefits of proactive maintenance (either preventive or predictive ) are clear. There’s no other way to solve issues before your clients become aware of them! But easier said than done, right? As incredible as it sounds, proactive maintenance may finally come as a byproduct of all the trends we’ve seen so far. If facility managers give in to the latest technology and start collecting data, they can achieve some kind of predictability. Once you have that predictability, your maintenance plan can become more proactive and even more incisive. There’s less overmaintenance and fewer repairs. As we’ve recently talked about with Cláudio Celino , an engineer who specialises in building maintenance, you need to use data and software to “finally stabilise the amount of preventive maintenance” and “reduce the number of repairs” at the same time. However, those are not the only advantages. As we all know, in times of crisis, facilities management may be one of the first departments to suffer a budget cut. That means it’s more important than ever to have predictability and find out which maintenance tasks can be deferred until the budget allows. AI and smart facilities management Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are enabling facility managers to achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and adaptability. Smart facilities leverage AI-driven predictive maintenance, which can prevent costly breakdowns by addressing issues before they arise. On the other hand, real-time data from IoT sensors provides actionable insights, enabling more efficient space utilisation and resource management. Advanced materials and equipment The materials and equipment used in FM are advancing, leading to stronger, more sustainable buildings. Innovations like self-healing concrete, advanced insulation, and high-performance HVAC systems provide durability and efficiency, lowering long-term maintenance needs. Modular construction techniques reduce waste and labour costs, allowing facilities to adapt quickly to organisational needs or expand when necessary. By adopting next-gen equipment and construction methods, facility managers can build infrastructure that is both resilient and future-ready, supporting sustainable goals whilst minimising environmental impact. Upskilling as the new hiring There wasn’t such a labour shortage crisis like the actual one since both World Wars. It was somehow the perfect storm — a rapid ageing of the Western population, COVID-19 popularising remote work and early retirement, and emergent trends such as the quiet quitting brought the labour market to its knees. According to a GlobalData report , the labour shortage is costing companies a good amount of money in increased wages and salaries, as well as supply chain disruptions. More companies than ever are worried about the issue and mentioning it in surveys and leaders’ conferences. If you don’t want to overpay even before you know if a new employer is a right fit, the answer is simple: upskill or reskill your current teams. Think about it for a second — in an era where employees want to feel valued and are increasingly demanding, what’s better than training your current team to bring added value to the table and suppress a need? When in doubt, look inside to those you already know and trust. Enable them, empower their careers and increase well-being and productivity levels within your business. And this leads us to the last main trend for 2025… Addressing FM talent shortages Technology is helping to bridge the labor gap in FM by automating routine tasks and streamlining workflows, allowing facility teams to focus on strategic projects. In addition, partnerships with contractors enable FM companies to access specialised skills on an as-needed basis without committing to full-time hires. This flexible approach helps companies scale their operations whilst ensuring that service quality remains high. Digital tools that support remote work, collaboration, and skill development are also contributing to a more adaptable workforce, which is essential in today’s labor-constrained environment. How can a collaborative FM platform help? A collaborative, centralised facilities management platform like Infraspeak allows staff to access training resources and task guides, empowering them to build new skills, resolve issues autonomously and take on more complex tasks with confidence. Historical data on maintenance needs is assured, helping facility managers make data-backed decisions when upgrading equipment or modifying structures.
