The Receiving Party may disclose, distribute, or disseminate the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any of its officers, directors, members, managers, partners, employees, contractors, advisers, or agents (its “Representatives”), provided that the Receiving Party reasonably believes that its Representatives have a need to know and such Representatives are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein. The Receiving Party will not disclose, distribute, or disseminate the Confidential Information to any third party, other than its Representatives, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party will at all times remain responsible for any violations of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. If the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Section. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Section, the Receiving Party may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that confidential treatment will be afforded such disclosed portion of the Confidential Information. ‍ 5.2. Specific Performance and Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges that in the event of a breach of Section 5.1 by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, substantial injury could result to the Disclosing Party and money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for such breach. Therefore, in the event that the Receiving Party or its Representatives engage in, or threaten to engage in, any act which violates Section 5.1, the Disclosing Party may be entitled, in addition to all other remedies which may be available to it under law, to seek injunctive relief (including, without limitation, temporary restraining orders or preliminary or permanent injunctions) and specific enforcement of the terms of Section 5.1. The Disclosing Party will not be required to post a bond or other security in connection with the granting of any such relief. ‍ 5.3. Feedback. While this Agreement is in effect, Customer may elect to provide Bigeye with feedback, comments, and suggestions with respect to the Product, the Improvements, or the Professional Services (“Feedback”). Bigeye will be free to use, reproduce, disclose, and otherwise exploit any and all such Feedback without compensation or attribution to Customer. ‍ 6. PROPERTY. All right, title, and interest in and to the Product, the Documentation, the Usage Data, the Aggregate Data, Improvements, Updates, and any other materials that Bigeye provides in connection with this Agreement, including all modifications, improvements, adaptations, enhancements, or translations made thereto, and all intellectual property rights therein, will be and remain the sole and exclusive property of Bigeye and its licensors. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in an Order Form, all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Content and Customer Analytics, and all proprietary rights therein, will be and remain Customer’s sole and exclusive property. ‍ 7. RESTRICTIONS ON USE; COMPLIANCE. 7.1. Restrictions on Use. Customer will not (and will not authorize, permit, or encourage any Authorized User or third party to): (i) allow anyone other than Authorized Users to access and use the Product; (ii) allow an Authorized User to share his or her access credentials with other Representatives of the Customer or any third party; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discern the source code or interface protocols of the Product; (iv) modify, adapt, or translate the Product; (v) make any copies of the Product; (vi) resell, distribute, or sublicense the Product or use any of the foregoing for the benefit of anyone other than Customer or the Authorized Users, without authorization from Bigeye; (vii) save, store, or archive any portion of the Product (including, without limitation, any source code contained therein) outside the Product other than those outputs generated through the intended functionality of the Product as set forth in the Documentation without the prior, written permission of Bigeye in each instance; (viii) remove or modify any proprietary markings or restrictive legends placed on the Product; (ix) use the Product in violation of any Applicable Law, in order to build a competitive product or service, or for any purpose not specifically permitted in this Agreement; (x) introduce, post, or upload to the Product any Prohibited Content; (xi) circumvent any processes, procedures, or technologies that Bigeye has put in place to safeguard the Product; or (xii) interfere with or attempt to interrupt the proper operation of the Product. Upon Bigeye’s request, Customer will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Bigeye in preventing and enforcing these restrictions. Customer will ensure that its Authorized Users comply with these restrictions and Customer will be fully liable for any Authorized User’s failure to do so. ‍ 7.2. Compliance. Bigeye has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ compliance with this Agreement. If any such monitoring reveals that Customer or its Authorized Users are not using the Product in compliance with this Agreement, then Customer will remedy any such non- compliance within five (5) business days of receiving notice from Bigeye, including, if applicable, through the payment of additional Fees. ‍ 8. CUSTOMER CONTENT AND CUSTOMER ANALYTICS; AGGREGATE DATA. ‍ 8.1. Customer Content and Customer Analytics. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer grants Bigeye a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers to vendors providing services to Bigeye (such as hosting providers), to reproduce, execute, use, store, archive, modify, perform, display, and distribute the Customer Content and Customer Analytics solely for the purpose of providing Customer with access to and usage of the Product hereunder. Bigeye shall treat any Customer Personal Data (as defined below) pursuant to the Data Processing Addendum attached hereto as Exhibit 2, which is hereby incorporated by reference and is subject to this Agreement. 8.2. Aggregate Data. Bigeye monitors the performance and use of the SaaS Product by its customers and collects data in connection therewith (“Usage Data”). Bigeye may create data records from Usage Data, Customer Content, and Customer Analytics by subjecting it to anonymization through the removal of all personal information and information about the source of such data. Additionally, Bigeye may combine Usage Data with other data, including Customer Content and Customer Analytics, and use such combined data, or a subset thereof, in an aggregate and anonymous manner (the “Aggregate Data”). Aggregate Data does not and shall not identify Customer or any individual. Aggregate Data does not identify Customer’s schema such as database, table, or column names. Once Usage Data, Customer Content, and Customer Analytics are aggregated and anonymized they are considered Aggregate Data. Bigeye may collect, use, publish, disseminate, sell, transfer, and otherwise exploit such Aggregate Data to improve the Product, for market research, industry analysis, and other similar purposes, for general business purposes, or as otherwise provided for in Bigeye’s Privacy Policy, available at https://www.bigeye.com/privacy/, which is incorporated herein by reference. ‍ 9.

GENERAL PROVISIONS. 12.1. Assignment. Neither Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Order Form without the prior, written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that a Party may, upon written notice to the other Party and without the consent of the other Party, assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any Order Form in connection with a change of control transaction (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests, sale of all or substantially all assets, or otherwise), provided that, the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any assignment or other transfer in violation of this Section will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and any Order Form will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. ‍ 12.2. Waiver.

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard for choice of law provisions thereof. ‍ 12.4. Exclusive Forum. The Parties hereby consent and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the County of San Francisco in the State of California for all suits, actions, or proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Order Form and waive any and all objections to such courts, including but not limited to, objections based on improper venue or inconvenient forum. ‍ 12.5.

Independent Contractors. As between themselves, the Parties are independent contractors. Neither Party will have any right, power, or authority to obligate the other Party or will be deemed to be an employee, agent, partner, joint venturer, or legal representative of the other Party for any purpose. ‍ 12.7. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or any Order Form is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision, and the remainder of this Agreement or Order Form will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement or any Order Form which is unenforceable in any jurisdiction, will be ineffective only as to that jurisdiction, and only to the extent of such unenforceability, without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof. ‍ 12.8. Force Majeure.

Customer will not export or re-export, either directly or indirectly, the Product or any copies thereof in such manner as to violate the export laws and regulations of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction in effect from time to time (including, without limitation, when such export or re- export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval). Without limiting the foregoing, Customer will not permit Authorized Users or any third parties to access or use the Product in violation of any United States export embargo, prohibition, or restriction. ‍ 12.12. Complete Understanding.

Security Incident Notification and Resolution. 6.1 Security Incident Notice . If Bigeye becomes aware of a Security Incident, Bigeye shall notify Customer without undue delay by email or, if email is unavailable, by phone. 6.2 Cooperation . Bigeye will provide reasonable information and cooperation to Customer so that Customer can fulfill any data breach reporting obligations it may have under (and in accordance with the timescales required by) applicable Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Bigeye. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer acknowledges that becauseBigeye personnel do not have visibility to the content of Customer Personal Data, it will be unlikely thatBigeye can provide information as to the particular nature of the Customer Personal Data, or where applicable, the identities, number or categories of any affected Data Subjects. ‍ 6.3 No-Fault Communications . Communications by or on behalf of Bigeye with Customer in connection with a Security Incident shall not be construed as an acknowledgment by Bigeye of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.

Help the world make magic with data. We believe data is one of the most powerful forces in society today, and it’s changing the way we work, play, and live. Like any resource, managing and controlling it will enable us to get more value from it. history How we started. Bigeye founders, Kyle Kirwan and Egor Gryaznov, met over a shared love of data—how powerful it can be when used well and what could be built. Egor led Uber’s first SQL bootcamp shortly after being hired, and Kyle attended it just to make sure this new Egor guy actually knew his stuff. They bonded over giving each other harder and harder SQL challenges. Together, they worked on the data pipelines for Uber’s in-house A/B testing tool —to report out standardized metrics for the company’s 1000s of experiments—where data quality was becoming a considerable challenge. With 100s of petabytes and 1000s of weekly data users, Uber’s data platform had grown in size and scale—along with the number of people and applications that depended on it. They discovered: Testing is good but doesn’t scale. Automation is important, but so is maintaining control and understandability. Analysts and engineers should work with the same tools to avoid blocking each other. In 2019, Kyle and Egor founded Bigeye—a data observability platform designed for data people, by data people. Bigeye’s platform does the work to improve the reliability of every dataset and pipeline. 500+ Data engineering customers WE’RE HIRING Bigeye is growing We’re proud to be a remote-first company with talented folks working across the United States, bringing a diversity of experience and perspective to work. customers Trusted by leading data teams.

Here are a few reasons why customers choose Bigeye over Monte Carlo Global anomaly detection Bigeye anomaly detection works globally on every monitor, even custom ones you create. In Monte Carlo, anomaly detection is only available out of the box for freshness and volume checks. Advanced tools for data engineers In addition to an intuitive UI, Bigeye offers the most robust “monitoring as code” tools on the market. Only Bigeye can help data engineering teams automate and manage data observability at enterprise scale. Real support for traditional data sources While Monte Carlo and Bigeye both support a wide range of cloud data warehouses, only Bigeye provides first-class support for traditional data sources including OLTP databases like MySQL and SQLserver. Enterprise scale and security Bigeye is built for large enterprise scale and security and includes role-based access controls, agent and agentless deployment models, and much more. “We really like that Bigeye lets us deploy monitoring as code and also monitor changes to the data models in our software development cycle. We’re not doing anything like that with Monte Carlo today.” Senior data engineer Fortune 500 Insurance and Banking Company [Citation: 3]
