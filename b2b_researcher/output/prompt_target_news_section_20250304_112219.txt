Ranks #2 on Top 100 List and #1 for Community Among Suppliers 
 Philadelphia, PA (October 16, 2024) — Aramark Healthcare+ , a leader in healthcare dining, nutrition, and facilities services, has been honored by Modern Healthcare with the #2 spot on its prestigious 2024 Best Places to Work in Healthcare list . 
 This national recognition highlights Aramark Healthcare+'s commitment to creating a positive work environment and increasing employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. It is a testament to the company’s dedication to its employees and its mission to promote the total wellbeing of every person it serves. 
 “Being recognized as number two on Modern Healthcare’s list of ‘Best Places to Work in Healthcare,’ is a true honor and a testament to who our employees are as people,” said Bart Kaericher, President &amp; CEO of Aramark Healthcare+. “Our people are the heart of our success. Every day, our teammates exemplify what it means to work with intent and purpose, and I’m so proud of their dedication, resilience, and unwavering commitment to our mission.” 
 Aramark Healthcare+ also took the top spot among suppliers in the Community Category , which recognizes companies who extend the caring mission into the broader community. 
 “In our company, we live and breathe a culture of care. We know that means caring for our patients, clients, caregivers, and each other,” Kaericher added. “Being named number one by Modern Healthcare for the Community Category is evidence of our care reaching far beyond the four walls of our healthcare partner locations, into the local communities where our teammates live and work.” 
 The People-First Culture 
 Central to the business’ success, and what sets it apart in the industry, is a radical commitment to people and the belief that a strong culture of care leads to strong results. This year, Aramark Healthcare+ brought this commitment to life with the activation of four cultural pillars: 
 
 i-matter: Emphasizes the importance of every individual, highlighting that everyone—and their actions—matter to patients, families, caregivers, clients, communities, and each other. 
 i-belong: Focuses on unity through a shared purpose and passion for healthcare, fostering a positive culture where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work. 
 i-lead: Encourages leadership with purpose, humility, advocacy for change, and heart. 
 i-inspire: A new initiative launching this month to further empower and motivate employees. 
 
 This past spring, over 125 employees were honored with Aramark Healthcare+’s inaugural Monarch Honors Recognition Awards for their significant impact on the lives of those served. The awards, inspired by the monarch butterfly and the butterfly effect principle, underscore the belief that every individual and every action matters. Each task, interaction, and effort by Aramark Healthcare+ teammates, no matter how small, contributes to the remarkable chain of events that drive the business’ long-term success. 
 “Whether it’s the food service team delivering trays to patients or the housekeeping staff ensuring clean, safe environments, every employee is encouraged to take ownership of their role in creating positive outcomes. At Aramark Healthcare+, we are all caregivers. Together, we serve with compassion. We solve challenges with every resource available. And we strengthen our relationships with everyone around us,” concluded Kaericher. 
 This recognition by Modern Healthcare underscores Aramark Healthcare+'s commitment to fostering a supportive and empowering work environment, ultimately enhancing the quality of care provided to patients.
